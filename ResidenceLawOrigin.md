Chapter 1  
General provisions

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p0027)

Section 1  
Purpose of the Act; scope

(1) This Act serves to manage the influx of foreigners into the Federal Republic of Germany. It enables and organises immigration with due regard to the capacities for admission and integration and the interests of the Federal Republic of Germany in terms of its economy and labour market. At the same time, the Act also serves to fulfil Germany’s humanitarian obligations. To this end, it regulates the entry, residence, economic activity and integration of foreigners. The provisions contained in other acts remain unaffected.

(2) This Act does not apply to foreigners

1.  whose legal status is regulated by the Act on the General Freedom of Movement for EU Citizens, in the absence of any legal provisions to the contrary,

2.  who are not subject to German jurisdiction according to the provisions of sections 18 to 20 of the Courts Constitution Act (_Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz_),

3.  who, by virtue of international treaties on diplomatic and consular communication and on the activities of international organisations and institutions, are exempt from immigration restrictions, from the obligation to notify the foreigners authority of their residence and from the requirement for a residence title, and when reciprocity applies, insofar as this may constitute a prerequisite for such exemptions.

Section 2  
Definitions

(1) A foreigner is anyone who is not German as defined in Article 116 (1) of the Basic Law (_Grundgesetz_).

(2) Economic activity is self-employment, employment as defined in section 7 of Book Four of the Social Code (_Sozialgesetzbuch_) and employment as a civil servant.

(3) Foreigners have a secure subsistence if they are able to earn a living, including sufficient health insurance coverage, without recourse to public funds. Drawing the following benefits does not constitute recourse to public funds:

1.  child benefits,

2.  children’s allowances, child-raising benefits, parental allowances,

3.  educational and training assistance in accordance with Book Three of the Social Code, the Federal Training Assistance Act (_Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz_) or the Upgrading Training Assistance Act (_Aufstiegsfortbildungsförderungsgesetz_),

4.  public funds based on own contributions or granted in order to enable residence in Germany and

5.  payments made in accordance with the Act on Advance Maintenance Payments (_Unterhaltsvorschussgesetz_). A foreigner who is enrolled in a statutory health insurance fund is deemed to have sufficient health insurance coverage.

Other family members’ contributions to household income are taken into account when issuing or renewing a temporary residence permit allowing the subsequent immigration of dependants. For the purpose of issuing a temporary residence permit in accordance with sections 16a to 16c, 16e and 16f, excluding participants in language courses not in preparation for a course of study, the subsistence of foreigners is deemed to be secure if they have funds in the amount of the monthly requirement as determined pursuant to sections 13 and 13a (1) of the Federal Training Assistance Act, and for the purpose of issuing a temporary residence permit in accordance with section 16g if they have funds in the amount of the monthly requirement as determined pursuant to section 12 of the Federal Training Assistance Act. For the purpose of issuing a temporary residence permit in accordance with sections 16d, 16f (1) for participants in language courses not in preparation for a course of study, and in accordance with section 17, the subsistence of foreigners is deemed to be secure if they have funds as determined in sentence 5 plus an additional 10 per cent of said funds. The Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community announces the minimum amounts defined in sentence 5 in the Federal Law Gazette for each calendar year by 31 August for the following year.

(4) The space which is required to accommodate a person in need of accommodation in state-subsidised welfare housing constitutes sufficient living space. Living space is not sufficient if it does not comply with the statutory provisions for Germans with regard to condition and occupancy. Children up to the age of two are not counted when calculating the sufficient living space for the accommodation of families.

(5) Schengen states are states in which the following legal acts apply in their entirety:

1.  Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders (OJ L 239, 22.9.2000, p. 19),

2.  Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2016 on a Union Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (OJ L 77, 23.3.2016, p. 1). and

3.  Regulation (EC) no. 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas (OJ L 243, 15.9.2009, p. 1).

(6) Temporary protection within the meaning of this Act is the granting of residence in application of Council Directive 2001/55/EC of 20 July 2001 on minimum standards for the granting of temporary protection in the case of the mass influx of displaced foreigners and on measures to promote the balanced distribution of the burdens associated with the admission of these persons and the consequences of such admission among the member states (OJ L 212, 7.8.2001, p. 12).

(7) Long-term residents are foreigners who have been granted the legal status of long-term resident in a member state of the European Union pursuant to Article 2 (b) of Council Directive 2003/109/EC of 25 November 2003 concerning the legal status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents (OJ L 16, 23.1.2004, p. 44), most recently amended by Directive 2011/51/EU (OJ L 132, 19.5. 2011. p. 1), and whose status has not subsequently been revoked.

(8) The EU long-term residence permit issued by another member state of the European Union pursuant to Article 8 of Directive 2003/109/EC constitutes long-term residence status (EU).

(9) Basic knowledge of the German language corresponds to Level A1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Recommendation no. R(98)6 of 17 March 1998 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to Member States concerning the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages – CEFR).

(10) Elementary knowledge of the German language corresponds to Level A2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

(11) Sufficient command of the German language corresponds to Level B1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

(11a) Good command of the German language corresponds to Level B2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

(12) Foreigners whose knowledge of the language corresponds to Level C1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages have an advanced command of the German language.

(12a) Vocational qualification in a state-recognised or similarly regulated occupation lasting at least two years as determined by federal or state provisions constitutes quality vocational training within the meaning of this Act.

(12b) Work requiring skills, knowledge and abilities acquired in a course of study or in quality vocational training constitutes skilled employment.

(12c) The following are educational institutions within the meaning of this Act:

1.  Firms providing basic or advanced occupational training,

2.  Schools, universities and educational institutions providing vocational training, and other institutions providing basic or advanced further training.

(13) Beneficiaries of international protection are foreigners who enjoy international protection within the meaning of

1.  Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third-country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted (OJ, L 304, 30.9.2004 p. 12), or

2.  Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 13 December 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted (OJ L 337, 20.12. 2011, p. 9).

(14) Insofar as Article 28 of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for ascertaining which member state is responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the member states by a third-country national or a stateless person (OJ L 180, 29.6.2013, p. 31) concerning detention for the purpose of transfer is relevant, section 62 (3) no. 4 and (3a) applies accordingly as regards the refutable presumption of the risk of the foreigner absconding within the meaning of Article 2 (n) of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 and section 62 (3b) nos. 1 to 5 applies accordingly as objective criteria for presuming that there is a risk of the foreigner absconding within the meaning of Article 2 (n) of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013; in all other cases, Article 28 (2) remains relevant within the scope of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013. Furthermore, indications of the risk of absconding may exist if:

1.  the foreigner has left a member state prior to the conclusion of proceedings being conducted there to determine competence or to examine an application for international protection and the circumstances of apprehension in the federal territory provide concrete indications that he or she does not intend to return to the competent member state in the foreseeable future,

2.  the foreigner has already filed several asylum applications in other member states under the scope of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 and has left the other member state without waiting for the outcome of the proceedings initiated there to determine competence or to examine the application for international protection.

The authority responsible for applying for detention for the purpose of transfer may detain a foreigner without a prior judicial order and place such foreigner in temporary custody, if

a)  there is a strong suspicion that the conditions defined in sentence 1 or 2 apply,

b)  it is not possible to obtain the court ruling on the order for custody to secure transfer beforehand and

c)  there is a well-founded suspicion that the foreigner intends to evade the order for detention for the purpose of transfer.

The foreigner is to be brought before the court without delay for a decision on ordering detention for the purpose of transfer. Section 62d and the provisions of the Act on Proceedings in Family Matters and in Matters of Non-Contentious Jurisdiction _(Gesetz über das Verfahren in Familiensachen und in den Angelegenheiten der freiwilligen Gerichtsbarkeit_) apply accordingly to the procedure for ordering detention for the purpose of transfer in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 604/2013, unless the procedure is regulated in another manner under Regulation (EU) No 604/2013.

Section 4  
Residence title requirement

(1) In order to enter and stay in the federal territory, foreigners require a residence title, in the absence of any provisions to the contrary in the law of the European Union or a statutory instrument and except where a right of residence exists as a result of the agreement of 12 September 1963 establishing an association between the European Economic Community and Turkey (Federal Law Gazette 1964 II, p. 509) (EEC/Turkey Association Agreement). Residence titles are granted in the form of

1.  a visa pursuant to section 6 (1), no. 1 and (3), a temporary residence permit (section 7),

2.  an EU Blue Card (section 18g), an ICT Card (section 19),

3.  a Mobile ICT Card (section 19b),

4.  a permanent settlement permit (section 9) or an EU long-term residence permit (section 9a).

The legal provisions governing temporary residence permits also apply to the EU Blue Card, the ICT Card and the Mobile ICT Card in the absence of any law or statutory instrument to the contrary.

(2) Foreigners who possess a right of residence in accordance with the EEC/Turkey Association Agreement are required to furnish evidence of a right of residence by possessing a temporary residence permit, unless they possess a permanent settlement permit or an EU long-term residence permit. Said residence permit is issued on application.

Section 4a  
Access to economic activity

(1) Foreigners holding a residence title may pursue an economic activity unless there is a law prohibiting such activity. The economic activity may be restricted by law. The pursuit of an economic activity going beyond a ban or restriction requires permission.

(2) If pursuing an employment is banned or restricted by law, pursuing an economic activity or an economic activity going beyond the restriction requires permission; such permission may be subject to approval by the Federal Employment Agency under section 39. The Federal Employment Agency may restrict its approval. If permission does not require approval by the Federal Employment Agency, section 39 (4) applies to the issuing of permission and section 40 (2) or (3) applies accordingly to the denial of permission.

(3) Every residence title must indicate whether the pursuit of an economic activity is permitted and whether it is subject to any restrictions. Furthermore, residence titles must indicate any restrictions on the pursuit of employment imposed by the Federal Employment Agency. Permission is required to change a restriction indicated in a residence title. If a residence title was granted for the purpose of a specific employment, pursuing another economic activity is prohibited as long as and to the extent that the competent authority has not given its permission. Sentences 2 and 3 do not apply if there is a change in ownership owing to a transfer of business as defined in section 613a of the Civil Code (_Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch_) or if there is a change in the legal form of the business.

(4) Foreigners not holding a residence title may only be employed in short-term employment subject to quotas or in seasonal work under the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners (_Beschäftigungsverordnung_) if they have a work permit from the Federal Employment Agency, and they may only pursue another economic activity if an inter-governmental agreement, a law or a statutory instrument entitles them to do so without a residence title or if the competent authority has given its permission.

(5) Foreigners may only be employed or commissioned to perform other paid work or services if they possess a residence title and if there is no relevant ban or restriction. Foreigners not holding a residence title may only be employed under the terms of subsection (4). Anyone employing a foreigner in the federal territory must

1.  check whether the requirements referred to in sentence 1 or 2 are met,

2.  keep a copy of the residence title, of the work permit from the Federal Employment Agency or of the certificate confirming permission to remain pending the asylum decision or confirming suspension of deportation, in electronic or paper form for the duration of the employment, and

3.  inform the competent foreigners authority within four weeks of having learnt of the fact that the employment for which a residence title was granted in line with Chapter 2 Division 4 was terminated earlier than envisaged.

Sentence 3 no. 1 also applies to those commissioning a foreigner on a sustained basis to perform paid work or services for gain.

Section 5  
General prerequisites for granting residence titles

(1) As a rule, a residence title is granted subject to the following conditions:

1.  the foreigner’s subsistence is secure;

1a.  the foreigner’s identity, and if he or she is not entitled to return to another state, nationality are established,

2.  there is no public interest in expelling the foreigner,

3.  if the foreigner is not entitled to a residence title, the foreigner’s stay does not threaten or jeopardise the interests of the Federal Republic of Germany for any other reason, and

4.  the passport obligation laid down in section 3 is met.

(2) Further, a temporary residence permit, EU Blue Card, ICT Card, permanent settlement permit or an EU long-term residence permit is granted on the condition that the foreigner

1.  has entered the country with the necessary visa and

2.  in the visa application, has already furnished the key information required for granting the title.

The requirements stipulated in sentence 1 may be waived if the prerequisites for granting a residence title are met; the requirements stipulated in sentence 1 are to be waived if special circumstances in the individual case concerned render a subsequent visa application procedure unreasonable. Sentence 2 does not apply to granting an ICT Card.

(3) Application of subsections (1) and (2) is to be waived in the cases of a residence title granted pursuant to section 24 or section 25 (1) to (3); application of subsection (1) nos. 1 to 2 and 4 and subsection (2) is to be waived in the cases of section 25 (4a) and (4b). Application of subsections (1) and (2) may be waived in the other cases of granting a residence title pursuant to Chapter 2 Division 5. Where application of subsection (1) no. 2 is waived, the foreigners authority may point out that expulsion is possible on account of certain public interests in expelling the foreigner which are the subject of criminal or other proceedings still in progress; such interests must be specified individually. Application of subsection (2) is to be waived in the event of a residence title granted pursuant to section 26 (3). Application of subsection (2) is to be waived in the event of a temporary residence permit granted pursuant to sections 18a, 18b, 19c (2) or Division 6 in application of section 10 (3) sentence 5.

(4) A residence title is to be denied if there is a public interest in expelling the foreigner under section 54 (1) nos. 2 or 4 or a corresponding deportation order has been issued under section 58a.

Section 6  
Visas

(1) A foreigner may be granted the following visas in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 810/2009:

1.  a visa for the purpose of transit through the territory of the Schengen states or for planned stays in this territory of up to 90 days within a 180-day period (Schengen visa),

2.  an airport transit visa for the purpose of passing through the international transit area at airports.

(2) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 810/2009, Schengen visas may be extended up to a total stay of 90 days within a 180-day period. A Schengen visa may be extended by a further 90 days within the 180-day period concerned as a national visa on the grounds stated in Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 810/2009/EC, to safeguard the interests of the Federal Republic of Germany or for reasons of international law.

(2a) Schengen visas do not entitle holders to pursue an economic activity unless they were issued for this purpose.

(3) A visa for the federal territory (national visa) is required for longer stays; this visa is granted before the foreigner enters the federal territory. It is issued on the basis of applicable provisions for a temporary residence permit, EU Blue Card, ICT Card, permanent settlement permit or EU long-term residence permit. The duration of lawful residence with a national visa is offset against the periods of possession of a temporary residence permit, EU Blue Card, permanent settlement permit or EU long-term residence permit.

(4) An exceptional visa within the meaning of section 14 (2) is granted as a visa within the meaning of subsection (1) no. 1 or subsection (3).

Section 7  
Temporary residence permit

(1) The temporary residence permit (_Aufenthaltserlaubnis_) is a residence title which is limited in time. It is issued for the purposes of residence stated in the following Divisions of this Act. In justified cases, a temporary residence permit may also be issued for a purpose of residence which is not covered by this Act. The residence permit defined in sentence 3 does not entitle the holder to pursue an economic activity; such activity may be permitted under section 4a (1).

(2) The temporary residence permit is to be subject to a time limit which takes due account of the intended purpose of residence. If a vital prerequisite for granting or extending the residence permit or for determining its duration ceases to apply, it is also possible to reduce the length of validity.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p0119)

Section 8  
Extending the temporary residence permit

(1) Extending the temporary residence permit is subject to the same regulations as granting it.

(2) As a general rule, the temporary residence permit may not be extended if, at the time the permit was granted or last extended, the competent authority prohibited an extension for a stay having only a temporary nature in line with the purpose of residence.

(3) Before the temporary residence permit is extended, it must be ascertained whether the foreigner has fulfilled the obligation to duly attend an integration course. If a foreigner breaches the obligation to duly attend an integration course pursuant to section 44a (1), sentence 1, this is to be taken into account when deciding whether to extend the temporary residence permit. As a general rule, if the foreigner is not entitled to a temporary residence permit, extension of the temporary residence permit is to be refused in the case of repeated and gross breach of the obligations referred to in sentence 1. If the foreigner is entitled to a temporary residence permit solely on the basis of this Act, extension may be refused unless the foreigner furnishes evidence that he or she has achieved integration into the community and society by other means. In deciding on this matter, due consideration is to be given to the duration of lawful stay, the foreigner’s legitimate ties to the federal territory and consequences of terminating residence for the foreigner’s dependants who are lawfully resident in the federal territory. If a foreigner was or is obliged to attend an integration course pursuant to section 44a (1), sentence 1, the temporary residence permit is to be extended for at most one year, as a general rule, if the foreigner has not successfully completed the integration course or has not yet furnished evidence that that he or she has achieved integration into the community and society by other means.

(4) Subsection (3) is not to be applied to the extension of a temporary residence permit granted pursuant to section 25 (1), (2) or (3).

Section 9  
Permanent settlement permit

(1) The permanent settlement permit (_Niederlassungserlaubnis_) is a residence title which is not limited in time. It may only be subject to an ancillary provision in the cases expressly permitted by this Act. Section 47 remains unaffected.

(2) A foreigner is to be granted a permanent settlement permit if

1.  the foreigner has held a temporary residence permit for five years,

2.  the foreigner’s subsistence is secure,

3.  the foreigner has paid compulsory or voluntary contributions into the statutory pension scheme for at least 60 months or furnishes evidence of an entitlement to comparable benefits from an insurance or pension scheme or from an insurance company; time off for the purposes of child care or nursing at home are to be duly taken into account,

4.  there are no reasons of public safety or order which would rule out granting such a permit, taking into account the severity or the nature of the breach of public safety or order or the threat posed by the foreigner, with due regard to the duration of the foreigner’s stay to date and the existence of ties in the federal territory,

5.  the foreigner is permitted to be in employment, if he or she is an employee,

6.  the foreigner possesses any other permits required for the purpose of the permanent pursuit of his or her economic activity,

7.  the foreigner has a sufficient command of the German language,

8.  the foreigner possesses a basic knowledge of the legal and social system and the way of life in the federal territory and

9.  the foreigner has sufficient living space for himself or herself and for family members living together in the same household.

The requirements of sentence 1, nos. 7 and 8 are deemed to be fulfilled if the foreigner has successfully completed an integration course. These requirements are waived if the foreigner is unable to fulfil them on account of a physical or mental illness or disability. In all other cases, the requirements of sentence 1, nos. 7 and 8 may also be waived to prevent hardship. Further, the aforesaid requirements are waived if the foreigner is able to communicate verbally in the German language at a basic level and was not entitled to participate in an integration course pursuant to section 44 (3), no. 2 or was not obliged to participate in an integration course pursuant to section 44a (2), no. 3. The requirements of sentence 1, nos. 2 and 3 are also waived if the foreigner is unable to fulfil them for the reasons stated in sentence 3.

(3) In the case of cohabiting spouses, it suffices if one spouse fulfils the requirements of subsection (2) sentence 1 nos. 3, 5 and 6. The requirement in accordance with subsection (2), sentence 1 no. 3 is waived if the foreigner is in education or training which leads to a recognised school, vocational or higher education qualification. Sentence 1 applies accordingly in the cases of section 26 (4).

(3a) A permanent settlement permit is to be granted to the spouse of a foreigner who possesses a permanent settlement permit pursuant to section 18c if the spouse

1.  lives with the foreigner in marital cohabitation,

2.  has held a temporary residence permit for three years,

3.  is employed for at least 20 hours per week and

4.  fulfils the conditions of subsection (2) sentence 1 nos. 2 and 4 to 9.

Subsection (2) sentences 2 to 6 applies accordingly. The granting of a permanent settlement permit under the conditions of subsection (3) remains unaffected.

(4) The following periods are counted towards the periods of possessing a temporary residence permit which are necessary to qualify for a permanent settlement permit:

1.  The duration of former possession of a temporary residence permit or permanent settlement permit, if the foreigner possessed a permanent settlement permit when he or she left the federal territory, minus the duration of intermediate stays outside of the federal territory which led to expiry of the permanent settlement permit; a maximum of four years is counted.

2.  A maximum of six months for each stay outside of the federal territory which did not lead to expiry of the temporary residence permit.

3.  Half of the period of lawful stay for the purposes of study or vocational training in the federal territory.

Section 9a  
EU long-term residence permit

(1) The EU long-term residence permit is a permanent residence title. Section 9 (1), sentences 2 and 3 apply accordingly. In the absence of any provisions to the contrary in this Act, the EU long-term residence permit is equivalent to the permanent settlement permit.

(2) A foreigner is to be issued an EU long-term residence permit pursuant to Article 2 (b) of Directive 2003/109/EC if

3.  the foreigner has a sufficient command of the German language,

4.  the foreigner possesses a basic knowledge of the legal and social system and the way of life in the federal territory,

5.  such a residence permit is not precluded by reasons of public safety or order, taking into account the severity or the nature of the breach of public safety or order or the danger emanating from the foreigner, and the duration of the foreigner’s stay to date and the existence of ties in the federal territory and

6.  the foreigner has sufficient living space for himself or herself and for family members living in the same household.

Section 9 (2), sentences 2 to 5 applies accordingly to sentence 1, nos. 3 and 4.

(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the foreigner

1.  has a residence title pursuant to Division 5 which was not granted on the basis of section 23 (2) or has a comparable legal status in another member state of the European Union and has not been granted international protection status in the Federal Republic of Germany or another member state of the European Union; the same applies if the foreigner has applied for such a title or such legal status, and the decision on this application is pending,

2.  has applied in another member state of the European Union for international protection status or for temporary protection within the meaning of section 24 and the decision on this application is pending,

a)  by virtue of a temporary residence permit under section 19c, where the time limit on the approval granted by the Federal Employment Agency is based on a maximum term of employment imposed pursuant to section 42 (1),

b)  if an extension to the temporary residence permit has been prohibited pursuant to section 8 (2) or

c)  if the temporary residence permit serves to enable the foreigner to live together or to continue to live together as a family with a foreigner who is only resident in the federal territory for a purpose of an inherently temporary nature, where no independent right of residence would arise if the family unity ended.

Section 9b  
Counting residence periods

(1) The following periods are counted towards the necessary periods pursuant to section 9a (2), sentence 1, no. 1:

1.  periods of residence outside of the federal territory during which the foreigner possessed a residence title and

a)  was resident abroad on account of having been sent to a foreign country in connection with his or her work, provided that such individual periods have not exceeded six months or a longer period stipulated by the foreigners authority pursuant to section 51 (1), no. 7, or

b)  the total periods do not exceed six consecutive months or, within the period stated in section 9a (2), sentence 1, no. 1, a total of 10 months,

2.  previous periods of residence in the federal territory with a temporary residence permit, permanent settlement permit or EU long-term residence permit, where the foreigner was in possession of a permanent settlement permit or an EU long-term residence permit at the time of leaving the federal territory and the permanent settlement permit or the EU long-term residence permit has expired solely on account of residence outside of member states of the European Union or due to acquisition of the legal status of long-term residence in another member state of the European Union, up to a maximum of four years,

3.  periods in which the foreigner was entitled to freedom of movement,

4.  half of any periods of lawful stay for the purposes of study or vocational training in the federal territory,

Periods of residence pursuant to section 9a (3), no. 5 and periods of residence in which the foreigner also met the conditions of section 9a (3), no. 3 are not counted. Periods of residence outside of the federal territory do not interrupt the period of residence pursuant to section 9a (2), sentence 1, no. 1 where the residence outside of the federal territory did not result in expiry of the residence title; such periods are not counted when determining the total duration of residence pursuant to section 9a (2), sentence 1, no. 1. In all other cases, exit from the federal territory interrupts the period of residence pursuant to section 9a (2), sentence 1, no. 1.

(2) The following periods of time are counted towards the periods required under section 9a (2) sentence 1 no. 1: periods in which the foreigner

1.  possessed an EU Blue Card issued by another member state of the European Union or

2.  possessed a residence title issued by another member state of the European Union

a)  for the purpose of employment in an occupation requiring a higher education qualification for which studies last at least three years and the member state has classified as at least Level 6 of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) or Level 6 of the European Qualifications Framework,

b)  for the purpose of research,

c)  for the purpose of study, or

if the foreigner, as holder of an EU Blue Card, had resided in the federal territory for at least two years at the time of application and possessed an EU Blue Card issued by another member state of the European Union immediately before being granted this EU Blue Card. Subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 4 applies accordingly to previous periods of residence with a residence title granted by another member state of the European Union for the purpose of study. Periods of residence outside of the European Union are not counted. However, such periods do not interrupt the period of residence pursuant to section 9a (2), sentence 1, no. 1 if they do not exceed 12 consecutive months and if they do not exceed a total of 18 months within the period laid down in section 9a (2), sentence 1, no. 1. Sentences 1 to 4 apply accordingly to the foreigner’s dependants who have been granted a temporary residence permit under sections 30 or 32.

Section 9c  
Subsistence

As a rule, foreigners have a fixed and regular income within the meaning of section 9a (2), sentence 1, no. 2 if

Section 10  
Residence titles and applications for asylum

(1) In the absence of a legal entitlement, a foreigner who has filed an application for asylum may be granted a residence title prior to the legally valid completion of the asylum procedure only with the approval of the supreme _Land_ authority, and only when vital interests of the Federal Republic of Germany so require. In the cases of a legal entitlement pursuant to section 18a or 18b, a residence title may be granted prior to the legally valid completion of the asylum procedure only with the approval of the supreme _Land_ authority, and only when vital interests of the Federal Republic of Germany so require.

(2) A residence title granted or extended by the foreigners authority after the foreigner has entered the federal territory may be extended in accordance with the provisions of this Act, irrespective of whether the foreigner has filed an application for asylum.

(3) A foreigner whose asylum application has been incontestably rejected or who has withdrawn the asylum application may be granted a residence title before leaving the federal territory only in accordance with the provisions of Division 5. If the asylum application has been rejected in accordance with section 30 (1), nos. 3 to 7 of the Asylum Act (_Asylgesetz_), no residence title may be granted before the foreigner leaves the federal territory. Sentences 1 and 2 do not apply if the foreigner is entitled to a residence title; further, sentence 2 is not applied if the foreigner meets the requirements for being granted a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 25 (3). No residence title pursuant to section 18a, 18b or 19c (2) may be granted before the foreigner leaves the federal territory if the foreigner’s asylum application has been incontestably rejected. Foreigners who have withdrawn their asylum application may be granted a residence title pursuant to section 18a, 18b or 19c (2) before leaving the federal territory only if they entered the federal territory before 29 March 2023; the same applies to a temporary residence permit granted according to Division 6 to the foreigner’s spouse and minor unmarried children.

Section 11  
Ban on entry and residence

(1) Bans on entry and residence are to be issued for foreigners who have been expelled, removed or deported or who are subject to a deportation order according to section 58a. Bans on entry and residence are also to be issued for foreigners who have been refused entry because they attempted to enter the federal territory using forged or falsified documents. As a result of the ban on entry and residence, the foreigner is permitted neither to re-enter nor to stay in the federal territory or the territory of another member state of the European Union or another Schengen state, nor may the foreigner be granted a residence title, even if he or she is entitled to one under this Act. If the foreigner is allowed to enter and stay in another member state of the European Union or another Schengen state, the ban on entry and residence does not extend to that member state of the European Union or that Schengen state.

(2) In the event of expulsion, a deportation order under section 58a or refusal of entry, a ban on entry and residence is to be issued together with the expulsion order, the deportation order under section 58a or the decision to refuse entry. In all other cases, the ban on entry and residence is to be issued, as a general rule, together with the deportation warning, the condition precedent being the deportation or removal, or at the latest at the time of deportation or removal. The length of the ban on entry and residence is to be set ex officio. The clock begins to run when the foreigner leaves the country or is refused entry. The length of the ban may be subject to conditions to prevent a threat to public safety and order, in particular requiring the foreigner to provide proof that he or she is not subject to prosecution or is not using illegal drugs. If the condition is not met before the ban expires, the ban is automatically extended at the time it would expire under sentence 5.

(3) A discretionary decision is taken regarding the length of the time limit of the entry and residence ban. It may not exceed five years, except in cases covered by subsections (5) to (5b).

(4) The ban on entry and residence may be revoked or shortened in order to uphold the legitimate interests of the foreigner, or if it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was imposed. As a general rule, the ban on entry and residence is to be revoked if the conditions for issuing a residence title pursuant to Chapter 2 Division 5 are met. When deciding whether the time limit of a residence and entry ban is to be shortened or whether the ban issued together with an expulsion order is to be revoked altogether, it is to be taken into account whether the foreigner met the obligation to leave the country within the period set for departure, unless the foreigner was prevented through no fault of his or her own from leaving or the period allowed for departure has been exceeded by an insignificant amount of time. The time limit of the entry and residence ban may be extended on the grounds of public safety and order. Subsection (3) applies accordingly.

(5) As a general rule, the length of the entry and residence ban is not to exceed 10 years if the foreigner was expelled on the ground of a criminal conviction or if the foreigner poses a serious threat to public safety and order. In these cases, subsection (4) applies accordingly.

(5a) As a general rule, the time limit of the entry and residence ban is to be 20 years if the foreigner was expelled on the ground of a crime against peace, of a war crime or a crime against humanity or to avert a terrorist threat or a threat to the security of the Federal Republic of Germany or a terrorist threat. In these cases, subsection (4) sentences 4 and 5 applies accordingly. As a general rule, reducing the length of the entry and residence ban or revoking it altogether is prohibited. The supreme _Land_ authority may permit exceptions to this rule in individual cases.

(5b) If the foreigner is deported from the federal territory on the basis of a deportation order under section 58a, a permanent entry and residence ban is to be issued as a general rule. In the cases covered by subsection (5a) or where the foreigner has been expelled on the ground of an interest in expulsion under section 54 (1) no. 1, 2 or 2a, a permanent entry and residence ban may be issued in the individual case. Subsection (5a) sentences 3 and 4 applies accordingly.

(5c) The authority which issues the expulsion order, the deportation warning or the deportation order pursuant to section 58a is also responsible for issuing the associated entry and residence ban and determining its length for the first time.

(6) A ban on entry and residence may be issued for foreigners who have not fulfilled the obligation to leave the country within the period allowed for departure, unless they were prevented from leaving through no fault of their own or have exceeded the period allowed for departure by an insignificant amount of time. Subsection (1) sentence 2, subsection (2) sentences 3 to 6, subsection (3) sentence 1 and subsection (4) sentences 1, 2 and 4 apply accordingly. The ban on entry and residence is to be limited in time when it is ordered in accordance with sentence 1. As a general rule, the first time a ban on entry and residence is ordered in accordance with sentence 1, its length is not to exceed one year. In all other cases, its length is not to exceed three years, as a general rule. No ban on entry and residence is ordered where there are grounds for temporarily suspending deportation pursuant to section 60a for which the foreigner was not responsible.

(7) The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees may issue a ban on entry and residence for a foreigner

1.  whose asylum application was rejected as manifestly unfounded under section 29a (1) of the Asylum Act, who was not granted subsidiary protection, for whom the existence of the conditions for issuing a deportation ban under section 60 (5) or (7) was not established and who does not possess a residence title or

2.  whose application under section 71 or section 71a of the Asylum Act repeatedly did not lead to a follow-up asylum procedure.

The ban on entry and residence takes effect when the decision on the application for asylum assumes legal validity. Subsection (1) sentences 3 and 4, subsection (2) sentences 3 to 6, subsection (3) sentence 1 and subsection (4) sentences 1, 2 and 4 apply accordingly. The ban on entry and residence is to be limited in time when it is ordered in accordance with sentence 1. As a general rule, the first time a ban on entry and residence is ordered in accordance with sentence 1, its length is not to exceed one year. In all other cases, its length is not to exceed three years, as a general rule. The competent foreigners authority decides on revoking, extending or shortening of the ban.

(8) Before the ban on entry and residence expires, the foreigner may, by way of exception, be allowed to enter the federal territory for a brief period if the foreigner’s presence is required for compelling reasons or if denying permission would constitute undue hardship. The supreme _Land_ authority is responsible for deciding in the cases covered covered by subsections (5a) and (5b).

(9) If a foreigner enters the federal territory in contravention of a ban on entry and residence, the running of a fixed period is suspended during the foreigner’s stay in in the federal territory. The period may be extended in such cases, at the most, however, by the length of the original ban. The foreigner is to be informed of this possibility when the length of the ban is set for the first time. Subsections (3) and (4) sentence 1 apply accordingly to a ban extended in accordance with sentence 2.

Section 12  
Area of application; ancillary provisions

(1) The residence title is issued for the federal territory. Its validity in accordance with the provisions of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement for residence in the territories of the contracting parties remains unaffected.

(2) The visa and the temporary residence permit may be issued and extended subject to conditions. Conditions, in particular geographic restrictions, may also be imposed subsequently on visas and temporary residence permits. In particular, geographic restrictions may be imposed on temporary residence permits in cases where there is public interest in expelling the foreigner pursuant to section 54 (1) nos. 1 or 1a and where restrictions are necessary to remove the foreigner from an environment in which he or she is more likely to commit serious crimes.

(3) A foreigner must immediately leave any part of the federal territory in which he or she may be staying without the permission of the foreigners authority in breach of a geographic restriction.

(4) The residence of a foreigner who does not require a residence title may be made subject to time limits, geographic restrictions, conditions and requirements.

(5) The foreigners authority may permit the foreigner to leave the geographic area to which he or she is restricted on the basis of this Act. This permission is to be granted if an urgent public interest applies, if it is necessary for compelling reasons or if denying permission would constitute undue hardship. The foreigner needs no permission for appointments at authorities or court hearings where his or her personal appearance is necessary.

Section 12a  
Residence rule

(1) In order to promote their lasting integration into the way of life in the Federal Republic of Germany, foreigners who have been granted asylum status, refugee status within the meaning of section 3 (1) of the Asylum Act, subsidiary protection status within the meaning of section 4 (1) of the Asylum Act or who have been granted a temporary residence permit for the first time pursuant to section 22, 23, section 24 (1) or section 25 (3) are required to take up their habitual residence (place of residence) in that _Land_ to which they have been allocated for the purposes of their asylum procedure or in the context of their admission process or in accordance with section 24 (3) for a period of three years from the time such status or temporary residence was granted. Sentence 1 does not apply where a foreigner, the foreigner’s spouse, registered civil partner or a minor unmarried child who is related to the foreigner and lives in a family household with the foreigner takes up or has taken up employment of at least 15 hours per week with full social security coverage, on account of which that person has an income amounting to at least the average monthly needs for individual persons pursuant to sections 20 and 22 of Book Two of the Social Code, or that person takes up or has taken up vocational training or is pursuing studies or is in a training relationship, or takes up, has taken up or has completed an integration course as referred to in section 43, a vocational language course as referred to in section 45a, a training measure lasting at least three months which leads to the recognition of occupational qualifications, or a further training measure as referred to in sections 81 and 82 of Book Three of the Social Code, if the course or training measure cannot be completed or continued in the place of residence stipulated in sentence 1 without delay. The period referred to in sentence 1 may be extended by the period during which the foreigner fails to meet the obligations stipulated in sentence 1. Where the grounds set out in sentence 2 cease to exist within a period of three months, the obligation to take up residence in accordance with sentence 1 continues to apply in the _Land_ to which the foreigner has moved his or her residence.

(1a) As soon as a foreigner whose habitual residence is determined by a distribution or allocation decision pursuant to Book Eight of the Social Code comes of age, subsection (1) is applied; the foreigner is required to reside in the _Land_ to which he or she was allocated most recently. The period of the foreigner’s residence in the allocated _Land_ until coming of age and after being granted asylum status, refugee status within the meaning of section 3 (1) of the Asylum Act or subsidiary protection status within the meaning of section 4 (1) of the Asylum Act or after being granted a residence title for the first time pursuant to section 22, section 23, section 24 (1) or section 25 (3) is counted towards the period stipulated in subsection (1) sentence 1.

(2) A foreigner who is subject to the obligation under subsection (1) and who is living in a reception centre or other temporary accommodation may, within six months of recognition, admission or the granting of a temporary residence permit under section 24(1), but no later than the expiry of the period referred to in subsection (1), be required, for the purpose of providing him or her with suitable accommodation, to take up residence in a specific place if this would not interfere with the foreigner’s lasting integration into the way of life in the Federal Republic of Germany. Insofar as it was not possible in an individual case to allocate suitable accommodation within six months, such allocation pursuant to sentence 1 may be made once within a further six months.

(3) In order to promote their lasting integration into the way of life in the Federal Republic of Germany, foreigners who are subject to the obligation pursuant to subsection (1) may be required, within six months of being granted recognition or the or a temporary residence permit for the first time, but no later than the expiry of the period referred to in subsection (1), to take up residence in a specific place if this can help them

1.  acquire suitable accommodation

2.  acquire sufficient oral command of the German language equivalent to Level B1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and

3.  take up an economic activity, taking into account the local conditions in the vocational training and labour market.

When taking decisions pursuant to sentence 1, specific local circumstances conducive to integration may also be taken into account, in particular the availability of educational and care services for minor children and juveniles.

(4) Foreigners who are subject to the obligation under subsection (1) may, in order to prevent social exclusion, also be prohibited, until the expiry of the period referred to in subsection (1), from taking up residence in a specific place, in particular if it is to be expected that they will not use German as their main language of communication there. This decision is to take into account the situation of the local vocational training and labour market.

(5) An obligation imposed or allocation made pursuant to subsections (1) to (4) is to be revoked upon application by the foreigner

1.  if the foreigner furnishes proof, in the event of being required or allocated pursuant to subsections (1) to (3) to take up residence at another place, or in the event of being prohibited from taking up residence in a specific place pursuant to subsection (4), that

a)  the foreigner or the foreigner’s spouse, registered civil partner or minor unmarried child who is related to the foreigner and lives in a family household with him or her is in employment with full social security coverage within the meaning of subsection (1) sentence 2 has an income which secures most of the foreigner’s subsistence or a vocational training place or a place in higher education; or

b)  an integration course as referred to in section 43, a vocational language course as referred to in section 45a, a training measure lasting at least three months which leads to the recognition of occupational qualifications, or a further training measure as referred to in sections 81 and 82 of Book Three of the Social Code is available soon to the foreigner or the foreigner’s spouse, registered civil partner or minor unmarried child who is related to the foreigner and lives in a family household with him or her, or

c)  the foreigner’s spouse, registered civil partner or a minor unmarried child who is related to the foreigner and previously lived in a family household with him or her resides elsewhere,

2.  to prevent hardship; in particular, hardship exists where

a)  the competent youth welfare office estimates that the local child and youth welfare benefits and measures pursuant to Book Eight of the Social Code would be negatively affected,

b)  acceptance by another _Land_ has been confirmed on other urgent, personal grounds or

c)  comparable unreasonable restrictions would arise for the person concerned on other grounds.

Where the grounds for revocation set out in sentence 1 no. 1 (a) cease to exist within a period of three months of notification of revocation, the obligation to take up residence in accordance with subsection (1) sentence 1 continues to exist in the _Land_ to which the foreigner has moved his or her residence. In the event of revocation under sentence 1 no. 2, the foreigner is to be subject to an obligation under subsection (3) or (4), at most until the period referred to in subsection (1) expires, account having been taken of the foreigner’s interests.

(6) Where dependants subsequently immigrate to rejoin a foreigner who is subject to an obligation or allocation pursuant to subsections (1) to (4), the obligation or allocation also applies to the dependants subsequently immigrating at most until the period applicable to the foreigner referred to in subsection (1) expires, unless the competent authority has ordered otherwise. Subsection (5) applies accordingly to the subsequently immigrating dependants.

(7) Subsections (1) to (6) do not apply to foreigners who were recognised or granted a temporary residence permit for the first time within the meaning of subsection (1) before 1 January 2016.

(8) Objections and actions filed against obligations pursuant to subsections (2) to (4) have no suspensory effect.

(9) With regard to foreigners who are subject to the obligation pursuant to subsection (1), the _Länder_ may, by way of statutory instruments of the _Land_ government or other _Land_ regulations, issue regulations specifying the organisation, procedure and suitable accommodation relating to

1.  their distribution within the _Land_ under subsection (2),

2.  the procedure for making allocations and imposing obligations under subsections (2) to (4),

3.  the requirements as to suitable accommodation within the meaning of subsections (2), (3) no. 1 and subsection (5) sentence 1 no. 1 (a), as well as the form of its proof,

4.  the manner of furnishing proof of employment with full social security coverage under subsection (1) sentence 2, income which secures subsistence, and of having a vocational training place or a place in higher education within the meaning of subsections (1) and (5) sentence 1 no. 1 (a),

5.  the obligation to be taken up by the municipality determined as the foreigner’s place of residence and the admission process.

(10) In specially justified cases, section (12) (2) sentence 2 remains unaffected as regards conditions restricting the permissible geographic area of residence.

Division 2  
Entry

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p0249)

Section 13  
Border crossing

(1) Entry into and exit from the federal territory is permitted only at the approved border crossing points and within the stipulated traffic hours, unless exceptions are permitted on the basis of other statutory provisions or intergovernmental agreements. When entering or leaving the federal territory, foreigners are required to carry a recognised and valid passport or passport substitute as referred to in section 3 (1) and to submit to the police control of cross-border traffic.

(2) A foreigner is deemed to have entered the federal territory only after having crossed the border and passed through the border checkpoint. Should the authorities charged with policing cross-border traffic allow a foreigner to pass through the border checkpoint for a specific temporary purpose prior to a decision on the refusal of entry (section 15 of this Act, sections 18, 18a of the Asylum Act) or during preparation, safeguarding or implementation of this measure, this does not constitute entry as defined in sentence 1 as long as the said authorities remain able to monitor the foreigner’s stay. In all other cases, a foreigner is deemed to have entered the federal territory when crossing the border.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p0252)

Section 14  
Unlawful entry; exceptional visa

(1) The entry of a foreigner into the federal territory is unlawful if the foreigner

1.  does not possess a passport or passport substitute as required in section 3 (1),

2.  does not possess the residence title as required in section 4,

2a.  does possess a visa required in section 4 upon entry, but obtained it by threat, bribery or collusion or by furnishing incorrect or incomplete information, for which reason it is revoked or annulled retrospectively, or

3.  is not permitted to enter the federal territory in accordance with section 11 (1), (6) or (7) unless the foreigner possesses a temporary entry permit as required in section 11 (8).

(2) The authorities charged with policing cross-border traffic may issue exceptional visa and passport substitutes.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p0259)

Section 15  
Refusal of entry

(1) A foreigner wishing to enter the federal territory unlawfully will be refused entry at the border.

(2) A foreigner may be refused entry at the border if

1.  there is a public interest in expelling the foreigner,

2.  there is a well-founded suspicion that the foreigner does not intend to stay in the federal territory for the stated purpose,

2a.  the foreigner only possesses a Schengen visa or is exempted from the visa requirement for a short-term stay and intends to pursue an economic activity in breach of section 4a (1), sentence 2, or

3.  the foreigner does not fulfil the conditions for entry into the territory of the parties signatory in accordance with Article 6 of the Schengen Borders Code.

(3) A foreigner who is exempted from the requirement to have a residence title for a temporary stay in the federal territory may be refused entry if the foreigner does not fulfil the requirements of section 3 (1) and section 5 (1).

(4) Section 60 (1) to (3), (5) and (7) to (9) applies accordingly. A foreigner who has filed an application for asylum may not be refused entry if the foreigner is permitted to stay in the federal territory in accordance with the provisions of the Asylum Act.

(5) In order to ensure that a refusal of entry is effective where a ruling to refuse entry has been issued and cannot be enforced immediately, the foreigner concerned is, as a general rule, to be taken into custody (detention pending exit from the federal territory) by virtue of a judicial order. In all other cases, section 62 (4) applies accordingly. Subsection does not apply in cases in which the judge declines to issue a corresponding judicial order or to extend the period of detention.

(6) Where the foreigner has reached the federal territory by air and has not entered the country as defined in section 13 but has been refused entry, the foreigner is to be taken to the transit area of an airport or to a place of accommodation from which he or she is able to leave the federal territory if detention pending exit from the federal territory is not applied for. The foreigner’s stay in the transit area of an airport or in accommodation pursuant to sentence 1 requires a judicial order no later than 30 days after the foreigner’s arrival at the airport or, if the time of arrival is impossible to ascertain, after the competent authorities become aware of the foreigner’s arrival. The judicial order is issued to ensure that the foreigner leaves the federal territory. It is permitted only where exit is to be expected within the term of the order. Subsection (5) applies accordingly.

Section 15a  
Allocation of foreigners who have entered the federal territory unlawfully

(1) Foreigners who enter the country unlawfully without applying for asylum and who, when their unlawful entry has been detected, cannot be placed in custody pending deportation and deported or expelled directly from custody must be allocated to the _Länder_ before deciding on the suspension of deportation or issuing a residence title. They are not entitled to be allocated to a specific _Land_ or a specific town or location. Allocation to the _Länder_ is carried out by a central allocation agency determined by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community. Unless another formula for allocation has been agreed among the _Länder_, the formula for the allocation of asylum applicants applies. Each _Land_ appoints up to seven authorities to request allocation by the agency appointed in accordance with sentence 3 and to admit the allocated foreigners. If the foreigner furnishes evidence prior to allocation that a household community exists between spouses or parents and their minor children or that other compelling reasons exist which conflict with allocation to a certain place, this is given due consideration in the allocation process.

(2) The foreigners authorities may require foreigners to present themselves to the authority requesting allocation. This does not apply when due consideration is to be given to evidence submitted in accordance with subsection (1) sentence 6. An obligation imposed in accordance with sentence 1 is not contestable. Any legal actions have no suspensive effect.

(3) The central allocation agency informs the authority which has requested allocation which reception centre is obliged to admit the foreigners concerned in accordance with sentences 2 and 3. If the _Land_ whose authority has requested allocation has not filled its admission quota, the _Land’s_ reception centre located nearest to this authority having capacity is obliged to admit the foreigners concerned. Otherwise, the reception centre designated by the central allocation agency on the basis of the allocation quota pursuant to section 45 of the Asylum Act and the available accommodation capacities is obliged to admit the foreigners concerned. Section 46 (4) and (5) of the Asylum Act applies accordingly.

(4) In the cases covered by subsection (3) sentence 3 the authority which has requested allocation pursuant to subsection (3) orders the foreigner to report to the reception centre designated as a result of the allocation process; in the cases covered by subsection (3) sentence 2 it may issue such an order. The foreigners authority forwards the result of the interview to the authority requesting allocation, which notifies the central allocation agency of the number of foreigners, stating the countries of origin and the results of the interview. Spouses and parents and their minor unmarried children are registered and allocated as a group. The foreigner must stay at this reception centre until re-allocated to another location within the _Land_, but only until deportation has been suspended or a residence title has been issued; sections 12 and 61 (1) remain unaffected. The _Land_ governments are authorised to regulate allocation within the _Land_ by statutory instrument, unless allocation is regulated by _Land_ law on the basis of this Act; section 50 (4) of the Asylum Act applies accordingly. The _Land_ governments may delegate the said authorisation to other bodies of the _Land_. Orders pursuant to sentence 1 are not contestable. Any legal actions have no suspensive effect. Sentences 7 and 8 apply accordingly, if an allocation order is issued on the basis of a _Land_ law or a statutory instrument pursuant to sentence 5.

(5) Following allocation, the competent authorities may permit the foreigner to take up residence in another _Land_. Following a permitted change of residence, the foreigner is deducted from the quota for the _Land_ from which he is released and added to the quota for the receiving _Land_.

(6) The provisions of subsections (1) to (5) do not apply to persons who verifiably entered the federal territory prior to 1 January 2005.

Section 16a  
Vocational training; advanced vocational training

(1) As a general rule, a foreigner is to be granted a temporary residence permit for the purpose of basic and advanced in-company vocational training if the Federal Employment Agency has granted approval in accordance with section 39 or it has been determined pursuant to the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners or by intergovernmental agreement that such basic and advanced vocational training is permissible without the approval of the Federal Employment Agency. During residence as referred to in sentence 1, no temporary residence permit may be granted for employment under section 19c (1) in conjunction with a provision of the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners for temporary employment. Section 9 does not apply unless the foreigner possessed a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 18a or 18b before the temporary residence permit pursuant to sentence 1 was granted. The residence purpose of quality in-company vocational training as referred to in sentence 1 also comprises German language courses preparing participants for vocational training, in particular job-related German language training in line with the Ordinance on German Language Training (_Deutschsprachförderverordnung_).

(2) As a general rule, foreigners are to be granted a temporary residence permit for the purpose of school-based vocational training, if such training leads to a state-recognised vocational qualification as determined by federal or state provisions, unless the qualification pathway is primarily tailored to nationals of one specific country. Bi- or multilateral agreements of the _Länder_ with public bodies in another country governing attendance of domestic schools by foreign school pupils remain unaffected. A temporary residence permit for the purpose of school attendance may only be issued on the basis of such agreements if the supreme _Land_ authority responsible for residence law has endorsed the agreement. Subsection (1) sentences 2 and 3 applies accordingly.

(3) The temporary residence permit only entitles the holder to pursue employment of up to 20 hours per week independent of the purpose referred to in subsection (1) or (2). As regards quality vocational training, foreigners are required to furnish proof that they have a sufficient command of the German language, if their command of the language required for the vocational training has not been tested by the educational institution and is not to be acquired in a preparatory German language course

(4) Before the temporary residence permit for the purpose of quality vocational training is withdrawn, revoked or its period of validity reduced retrospectively pursuant to section 7 (2) sentence 2, the foreigner is to be given the opportunity, for a period of up to six months, to find a place on another training course.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p0285)

Section 16b  
Higher education

(1) For the purpose of full-time studies at a state or state-recognised university or a comparable educational institution, a foreigner is granted a temporary residence permit if he or she has been accepted by the educational institution. Residence for study purposes also extends to measures to prepare for studies and compulsory training. Measures to prepare for studies are

1.  attending a language course to prepare for studies, if the foreigner has been accepted for full-time studies and the acceptance depends on the foreigner attending the preparatory language course, and

2.  attending a preparatory or comparable course prior to studying, if the foreigner can prove that he or she has been accepted for the preparatory or comparable course.

Proof of knowledge of the language needed for the specific course of studies is only required if the foreigner’s knowledge of the language has not been tested in the decision on acceptance and language acquisition is not the aim of the preparatory measures for the course of study.

(2) The period of validity when the temporary residence permit for study purposes is granted for the first time and for each subsequent extension is, as a rule, two years and is not generally to be less than one year. The period of validity is at least two years if the foreigner takes part in Union or multilateral programmes that comprise mobility measures or if the foreigner is covered by an agreement between two or more higher education institutions. Where the course of study takes less than two years, the temporary residence permit is granted only for the duration of the course of study. The temporary residence permit is extended if the purpose of residence has not yet been achieved and is achievable within a reasonable period of time. The host educational institution may be consulted to find out whether the purpose of residence is still achievable.

(3) In accordance with the following sentences, the temporary residence permit only entitles the holder to employment of up to a total of 140 working days per year (working day account). Student jobs are not counted. Part-time employment will be counted as follows in the way most favourable for the foreigner:

1.  every day on which the working time does not exceed four hours may be counted for the working day account as one-half working day, otherwise as a full working day, or

2.  employment may be counted for the working day account per calendar week

a)  during the semester, if a maximum of 20 hours per calendar week are worked, and

b)  other than during the semester

independent of how the working time is distributed, as two and one-half working days. The most favourable method as referred to in sentence 3 means determining for each calendar week whether the employment is counted according to sentence 3 no. 1 or no. 2.

(4) During residence as referred to in subsection (1), no temporary residence permit may be granted for employment under section 19c (1) in conjunction with a provision of the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners for temporary employment. Section 9 does not apply.

(5) A foreigner may be granted a temporary residence permit, if

1.  the foreigner has been accepted by a state or state-recognised or comparable educational institution

a)  for full-time studies, with acceptance dependent on a condition which does not aim at attending measures to prepare for studies,

b)  for full-time studies, with acceptance dependent on attending a preparatory or comparable course, but the foreigner is unable to furnish proof of being accepted for a preparatory or comparable course pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 3 no. 2 or

c)  for part-time studies,

2.  the foreigner has been enrolled in a preparatory language course, without having been accepted for a course of study by a state or state-recognised university or a comparable educational institution, or

3.  the foreigner has been accepted for a preparatory company traineeship.

In the cases covered by sentence 1 no. 1, subsection (1) sentences 2 to 4 and subsections (2) to (4) apply accordingly. In the cases covered by sentence 1 nos. 2 and 3, subsections (2) to (4) are to be applied accordingly; in addition, the temporary residence permit allows holders to work as a trainee pursuant to sentence 1 no. 3.

(6) Before the temporary residence permit under subsection (1) or (5) is withdrawn, revoked or its period of validity reduced pursuant to section 7 (2) sentence 2 for reasons which are beyond the foreigner’s control, the foreigner is to be given the opportunity, for a period of up to nine months, to apply for admission to another educational institution.

(7) Foreigners who have been granted international protection status in another member state of the European Union are, as a general rule, to be granted a temporary residence permit for study purposes if they pursued studies in another EU member state for at least two years and the requirements of section 16c (1) sentence 1 nos. 2 and 3 apply. The temporary residence permit will be granted for the part of the studies to be carried out in Germany. Subsection (3) applies accordingly. Section 9 does not apply.

(8) Subsections (1) to (4) and (6) serve to implement Directive 2016/801/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of research, studies, training, voluntary service, pupil exchange schemes or educational projects and au pairing (OJ L 132, 21.5.2016, p. 21).

Section 16c  
Mobility of students

(1) In derogation from section 4 (1), a foreigner does not require a residence title for stays for study purposes not exceeding 360 days, if the host educational institution in the federal territory has notified the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees and the competent authority of the other member state that the foreigner intends to carry out part of the studies in the federal territory, submitting the following to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees at the same time:

1.  evidence that the foreigner has a residence title for study purposes from another member state of the European Union which is valid for the duration of the planned stay and falls within the scope of Directive 2016/801/EU,

2.  evidence that the foreigner wishes to carry out part of the studies at an educational institution in the federal territory, because he or she is taking part in a Union or multilateral programme that comprises mobility measures or because he or she is covered by an agreement between two or more higher education institutions.

3.  evidence that the foreigner has been accepted by the host educational institution,

4.  a copy of the foreigner’s recognised and valid passport or passport substitute, and

5.  and evidence that the foreigner’s subsistence is secure.

The host educational institution must notify the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees when the foreigner applies for a residence title in the scope of Directive 2016/801/EU in another member state of the European Union. If, at the time of application, the host educational institution is not yet aware of the foreigner’s intention to carry out part of the studies in the federal territory, it is to notify the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees as soon as it becomes aware of this intention. If the residence title pursuant to sentence 1 no. 1 has been issued by a non-Schengen state, and if the foreigner enters the federal territory via a non-Schengen state, the foreigner must carry a copy of the notification and present it to the responsible authorities at their request.

(2) If the notification was made at the time referred to in subsection (1) sentence 2 and if the foreigner is not denied entry and residence in accordance with section 19f (5), the foreigner may enter the federal territory at any time during the validity of the residence title issued by another member state as referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 1 and stay there to study. If the notification was made at the time referred to in subsection (1) sentence 3 and if the foreigner was not denied entry and residence in accordance with section 19f (5), the foreigner may enter the federal territory and stay there to study. During the stay referred to in subsection (1), section 16b (3) applies subject to the proviso that if the foreigner’s stay is less than 360 days, the foreigner is only entitled to take up employment for a reduced number of days in the same proportion to the stay as allowed by the working day account.

(3) If a foreigner is denied entry and residence under section 19f (5), the foreigner must cease the studies immediately. The exemption from the obligation to hold a residence title which applied in accordance with subsection (1) sentence 1 ceases to exist.

(4) If, within 30 days of receipt of the notification referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1, the foreigner has not been denied entry and residence in line with section 19f (5), the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees is to issue the foreigner with a certificate confirming the entitlement to enter and stay in the federal territory to study as part of short-term mobility.

(5) Once a foreigner has been denied entry and residence under section 19f (5) or the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees has issued a certificate within the meaning of subsection (4), responsibility for further measures and decisions under residence law rests with the foreigners authority, as set out in section 71 (1). (3) The foreigner and the host educational institution are required to inform the foreigners authority of any changes to the requirements stipulated in subsection (1).

Section 16d  
Measures regarding the recognition of foreign occupational qualifications

(1) For the purpose of recognising occupational qualifications which a foreigner has acquired abroad, a foreigner is to be granted a temporary residence permit to undertake a qualification measure and to take a subsequent examination, if a body responsible according to federal or _Länder_ regulations regarding recognition of occupational qualifications has determined that adaptation or compensation measures or further qualifications are necessary

1.  to establish the equivalence of the occupational qualification with a German occupational qualification or

2.  to grant authorisation to work in an occupation which is regulated in Germany.

The granting of a temporary residence permit is subject to the following conditions:

1.  the foreigner has a command of the German language necessary for the qualification measure; as a rule that is at least an elementary knowledge of the German language,

2.  the qualification measure is suited to enabling recognition of the foreigner’s occupational qualification or access to the occupation, and

3.  in the case of primarily in-company training, the Federal Employment Agency has granted approval in accordance with section 39 or it has been determined pursuant to the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners or by intergovernmental agreement that participating in the qualification measure is permissible without the approval of the Federal Employment Agency.

The temporary residence permit is issued for a period of up to 24 months and is extended by a maximum of 12 months, to add up to a maximum period of residence of three years. It only entitles the holder to pursue employment which is independent of the qualification measure for up to 20 hours per week.

(2) The temporary residence permit referred to in subsection (1) also entitles the holder to pursue employment which is not restricted in terms of time and whose requirements are connected to the specialist skills needed in the later employment if the Federal Employment Agency has granted approval in accordance with section 39 or it has been determined pursuant to the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners that such employment is permissible without the approval of the Federal Employment Agency. Section 18 (2) no. 3 applies accordingly.

(3) As a general rule, foreigners are to be granted a temporary residence permit to work in skilled employment while waiting for their vocational qualification acquired abroad to be recognised, if

1.  the foreigner

a)  has a foreign occupational qualification which is officially recognised by the country where it was acquired and which can only be acquired after completing training which takes at least two years, or

b)  holds a foreign higher education qualification which is officially recognised in the country where it was acquired, and

2.  the foreigner has a concrete job offer,

3.  the agreement to be concluded between the foreigner and the employer states that

a)  the foreigner agrees to initiate, immediately after entering Germany at the latest, the procedure for recognising the foreign occupational qualification with the body responsible according to federal or _Länder_ regulations for the recognition of occupational qualifications, and

b)  the employer agrees to enable the foreigner to undertake, as part of the employment relationship, the qualification measures required by the responsible body to recognise the foreigner’s occupational qualification,

4.  the employer is a suitable provider of initial or subsequent training,

5.  the foreigner has a command of the German language necessary for the envisaged employment, or at least an elementary knowledge of the German language, and

6.  the Federal Employment Agency has granted approval in accordance with section 39 or it has been determined pursuant to the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners or by intergovernmental agreement that such employment is permissible without the approval of the Federal Employment Agency.

The requirement of skilled employment as referred to in sentence 1 is to be waived if an authorisation is needed for this employment and

1.  the employer is bound by a collective agreement, or the employer is a religious organisation bound by the regulations of committees with equal representation which determine terms of employment based on church law,

2.  the employer employs the foreigner according to the terms of employment of the applicable collective agreement or the terms of employment determined on the basis of church law, and

3.  the classification and the pay are commensurate to employment whose requirements lead to work in the desired occupation.

The requirement of skilled employment as referred to in sentence 1 is to be waived as well if an authorisation is needed for this employment and

1.  the employer is a licensed health-care facility according to section 72 of Book Eleven of the Social Code, and

2.  the classification and the pay are commensurate to employment whose requirements lead to work in the desired occupation.

The foreigner is required to to obtain confirmation from a competent German authority that the foreigner fulfils the prerequisites of sentence 1 no. 1 (a) or (b). The temporary residence permit is granted for the first time for the length of time approved by the Federal Employment Agency but no longer than one year, and is extended up to a maximum period of residence of three years. After the maximum period of the temporary residence permit has expired, no residence permit may be granted pursuant to sections 16d and 19c (1) in conjunction with a provision of the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners for temporary employment. Section 9 does not apply. The temporary residence permit only entitles the holder to pursue employment under sentence 1, 2 or 3 no. 2 and to secondary employment of up to 20 hours per week.

(4) As a general rule, a foreigner is to be granted a temporary residence permit for a year to have the occupational qualification acquired abroad recognised and the permit is to be extended by 12 months up to a maximum period of residence of three years, if the foreigner, on the basis of an agreement between the Federal Employment Agency and the employment administration of the foreigner’s country of origin, has been placed in a job

1.  using the procedure, selection, placement and the process to establish the equivalence of the occupational qualification with a German occupational qualification and to grant the authorisation to work in occupations in the health and care sector regulated by federal or _Land_ law, or

2.  using the procedure, selection, placement and the process to establish the equivalence of the occupational qualification with a German occupational qualification and, where necessary, to grant the authorisation to work in other specific occupations, taking into account the adequacy of the training structures in the country of origin

and the Federal Employment Agency has granted approval in accordance with section 39 or it has been determined pursuant to the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners or by intergovernmental agreement that granting a temporary residence permit is permissible without the approval of the Federal Employment Agency. Moreover, foreigners must have the command of the German language laid down in the agreement; as a general rule that is an elementary knowledge of the German language. The temporary residence permit only entitles the holder to pursue employment which is independent of the occupational qualification to be recognised for up to 20 hours per week.

(5) As a general rule, a foreigner is to be granted a temporary residence permit in order to take an examination for the recognition of a foreign occupational qualification, if the foreigner has the necessary command of the German language for the examination, as a rule at least an elementary knowledge of the German language, unless the examination is intended to demonstrate a command of the German language. The residence permit does not entitle the holder to pursue an economic activity.

(6) As a general rule, a foreigner is to be granted a temporary residence permit for up to six months in order to determine whether he or she has the relevant occupational skills, knowledge and abilities needed to establish the equivalence of the vocational qualification acquired abroad (analysis of qualifications) and which qualify him or her to work in a skilled occupation. The granting of a temporary residence permit is subject to the following conditions:

1.  the competent authority has decided that the legal requirements for a different procedure to establish the equivalence of the vocational qualification acquired abroad are met and carrying out an analysis of qualifications has been approved,

2.  the foreigner has a command of the German language corresponding to the analysis of qualifications to be carried out, as a rule at least an elementary knowledge of the German language.

Subsection (1) sentence 4 and subsection (2) apply accordingly. If the competent authority determines, after completing the procedure, that adaptation or compensation measures are necessary, the foreigner’s residence under subsection (1) or subsection (3) may continue provided the requirements specified there are met. The length of residence referred to in sentence 1 is not counted as part of the maximum period of residence referred to in subsection (1) and subsection (3).

Section 16f  
Language courses and school attendance

(1) A foreigner may be granted a temporary residence permit to attend language courses which do not serve to prepare for a course of study or to participate in a pupil exchange scheme. A temporary residence permit for participation in a pupil exchange scheme may also be granted in cases where there is no direct exchange.

(2) As a general rule, a foreigner is to be granted a temporary residence permit to attend school as of grade nine, provided it is guaranteed that the school class comprises pupils of various nationalities and that the school

1.  is a state or state-recognised school with an international orientation or

2.  is a school which is not or not primarily funded from public funds and prepares pupils for international qualifications, qualifications issued by other countries or state-recognised qualifications.

After staying in Germany to take part in a pupil exchange scheme foreign pupils may only be granted a temporary residence permit for another purpose if they are legally entitled to it. Section 9 does not apply. The temporary residence permit under subsection (1) to attend a language course only entitles the foreigner to pursue employment of up to 20 hours per week.

(4) Bi- or multi-lateral agreements of the _Länder_ with public bodies in another country governing attendance of domestic schools by foreign pupils remain unaffected. A temporary residence permit to attend school can only be issued on the basis of such agreements if the supreme _Land_ authority responsible for residence law has endorsed the agreement.

Section 18  
Principle of skilled immigration; general provisions

(1) The admission of foreign employees is geared to the requirements associated with making Germany an attractive place to conduct business and research, giving due consideration to the labour market situation. The opportunities given to foreign workers and skilled workers serve to guarantee the supply of labour and to strengthen the social security systems. They are intended to promote the lasting integration of skilled workers and experienced workers in society and the labour market, with due consideration of public security interests.

(2) A residence title to take up employment is granted subject to the following conditions:

1.  the foreigner has a concrete job offer,

2.  the Federal Employment Agency has given its approval under section 39; this does not apply if it has been determined by law, intergovernmental agreement or pursuant to the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners that employment is permissible without the approval of the Federal Employment Agency; in this case, the residence title may also be denied if one of the conditions stipulated in section 40 (2) or (3) exists,

3.  the authorisation to work in the occupation has been granted or promised, if necessary,

4.  the equivalence of the qualification has been established or the foreigner has a foreign higher education qualification which is recognised or otherwise comparable to a German higher education qualification to the extent that this is a condition for being granted the residence title,

4a.  the foreigner and the employer provide assurances that the job will in fact be performed, and

5.  where a foreigner who is 45 years of age or older and has been granted a residence title for the first time under sections 18a or 18b, has a salary corresponding to at least 55 per cent of the annual earnings ceiling of the general pension scheme, unless the foreigner can prove that he or she possesses adequate provision for old age. The conditions of sentence 1 may be waived if there is a public interest, and in particular a regional, economic or labour market interest in the foreigner’s employment, in particular if the salary is only slightly below the minimum level or the foreigner’s age is only slightly above the age limit. The Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community announces the minimum salaries in the Federal Gazette annually by 31 December for the following calendar year.

(3) For the purposes of this Act, a skilled worker means a foreigner who

1.  has successfully completed quality vocational training in Germany or has a foreign quality vocational qualification which is equivalent to one acquired in Germany (skilled worker with vocational training qualification), or

2.  has a German higher education qualification, a recognised foreign higher education qualification or a foreign higher education qualification comparable to a German one (skilled worker holding a higher education qualification).

(4) Residence titles under sections 18a, 18b, 18g and 19c are granted for a period of four years or for a shorter period plus an additional three months, but not to exceed four years, if the employment relationship or the approval by the Federal Employment Agency is limited to a shorter period.

(3) As a general rule, a highly skilled worker holding a university degree is to be granted a permanent settlement permit in special cases without the consent of the Federal Employment Agency if there is reason to assume that integration into the way of life in the Federal Republic of Germany and the foreigner's subsistence without state assistance are assured and if the requirements of section 9 (2) sentence 1 no. 4 are met. The _Land_ government may stipulate that granting the permanent settlement permit pursuant to sentence 1 requires the approval of the supreme _Land_ authority or a body designated by it.

Section 18d  
Research

(1) A foreigner is granted a temporary residence permit for research purposes in accordance with Directive 2016/801/EU without the consent of the Federal Employment Agency if

(2) As a general rule, the requirement stipulated in subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 2 is to be waived if the activities of the research organisation are financed primarily from public funds. The requirement may be waived where there is a special public interest in the research project.

Section 18e  
Short-term mobility for researchers

(1) In derogation from section 4 (1), a foreigner does not require a residence title for stays for research purposes not exceeding 180 days in a 360-day period, if the host research organisation in the federal territory has notified the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees and the competent authority of the other member state that the foreigner intends to carry out part of the research in the federal territory, submitting the following to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees at the same time:

1.  evidence that the foreigner possesses a valid residence title for research purposes issued by another member state in accordance with Directive 2016/801/EU,

2.  the hosting agreement or an equivalent contract concluded with the host research organisation in the federal territory,

3.  a copy of the foreigner’s recognised and valid passport or passport substitute, and

4.  evidence that the foreigner’s subsistence is secure.

The host research organisation is to make the notification when the foreigner applies for a residence title in the scope of Directive 2016/801/EU in another member state of the European Union. If, at the time of application, the host research organisation is not yet aware of the foreigner’s intention to carry out part of the research in the federal territory, it must make the notification as soon as it becomes aware of this intention. If the residence title pursuant to sentence 1 no. 1 has been issued by a non-Schengen state, and if the foreigner enters the federal territory via a non-Schengen state, the foreigner must carry a copy of the notification and present it to the competent authorities at their request.

(2) If the notification was made at the time referred to in subsection (1) sentence 2, and if the foreigner has not been denied entry and residence under section 19f (5), the foreigner may enter the federal territory at any time during the validity of the residence title and stay there for research purposes. If the notification was made at the time referred to in subsection (1) sentence 3, the foreigner may enter the federal territory at any time after the notification is received and during the validity of the residence title issued by the other member state as referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 1 and stay there for research purposes.

(3) Foreigners who fulfil the requirements stipulated in subsection (1) are entitled to take up research in the host research organisation and to take up teaching activities.

(4) If a foreigner is denied entry and residence pursuant to section 19f (5), the foreigner must cease the research activities immediately. The exemption from the obligation to hold a residence title under subsection (1) sentence 1 ceases to exist.

(5) If the foreigner is not denied entry and residence in line with section 19f (5), the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees issues the foreigner with a certificate confirming the entitlement to enter and stay in the federal territory for research purposes as part of short-term mobility.

(6) Once a foreigner has been denied entry and residence under section 19f (5) or the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees has issued a certificate within the meaning of subsection (5), responsibility for further measures and decisions under residence law rests with the foreigners authority, as set out in section 71 (1). (4) The foreigner and the host research organisation are required to inform the foreigners authority of any changes to the requirements stipulated in subsection (1).

Section 18g  
The EU Blue Card

(1) Skilled workers holding a university degree are granted an EU Blue Card without the consent of the Federal Employment Agency for employment in Germany commensurate with their qualification, if they have a salary corresponding to at least 50 per cent of the annual earnings ceiling of the general pension scheme and if none of the reasons for refusal regulated in section 19f (1) and (2) exist. Skilled workers holding a university degree who

1.  are employed in occupations which belong to the groups 132, 133, 134, 21, 221, 222, 225, 226, 23 or 25 according to the Commission Recommendation of 29 October 2009 on the use of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08) (OJ L 292, 10.11.2009, p. 31) or

2.  have obtained a higher education qualification no more than three years prior to applying for an EU Blue Card,

are granted an EU Blue Card in derogation from sentence 1 with the approval of the Federal Employment Agency if their salary is at least 45.3 per cent of the annual earnings ceiling of the general pension scheme. The requirements of section 18 (2) no. 3 are deemed to have been met if the skilled worker holds a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 18b and the same authorisation to work in an occupation is required for employment in the occupation with the EU Blue Card as for the temporary residence permit pursuant to section 18b. The requirements of section 18 (2) no. 4 are deemed to have been met if the skilled worker holds a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 18b and presented the same higher education qualification to be granted the residence permit that is required for the EU Blue Card. Sentences 1 to 4 apply accordingly to skilled workers who have successfully completed a programme of tertiary education which is equivalent to a higher education degree and takes at least three years of training to complete, if this qualification corresponds to the level of training that in the Federal Republic of Germany is classified as at least Level 6 of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011) or Level 6 of the European Qualifications Framework.

(2) In derogation from section 18 (2) no. 4, a foreigner who does not meet the requirements of subsection (1) is granted an EU Blue Card with the approval of the Federal Employment Office for the purpose of employment in Germany in an occupation commensurate to his or her qualifications which belongs to Group 133 or 25 according to the Commission Recommendation of 29 October 2009 on the use of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08) (OJ L 292, 10.11.2009, p. 31) if

1.  their salary is at least 45.3 per cent of the annual earnings ceiling of the general pension scheme,

2.  none of the grounds for rejection referred to in section 19f (1) and (2) applies, and

3.  the foreigner has skills, knowledge and abilities

a)  based on at least three years of occupational experience gained within the past seven years in an occupation which belongs to Group 133 or 25 according to the Commission Recommendation of 29 October 2009 on the use of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08) (OJ L 292, 10.11.2009, p. 31),

b)  at a level which is comparable to a higher education qualification or qualification from a tertiary programme of education which is equivalent to higher education studies and fulfils all the requirements of subsection (1) sentence 5, and

c)  required for employment in the occupation.

(3) Granting an EU Blue Card requires that the concrete job offer under section 18 (2) no. 1 provides for employment of at least six months.

(4) In derogation from section 4a (3) sentence 4, a holder of an EU Blue Card does not need the permission of the foreigners authority to change jobs. During the first 12 months of employment, the competent foreigners authority may suspend all job changes by a holder of an EU Blue Card for 30 days and refuse job changes within this period if, following the job change, the requirements for granting an EU Blue Card are no longer met.

(5) For the purpose of granting an EU Blue Card, the subsistence of a foreigner is deemed to be secure if the foreigner possesses a temporary residence permit in accordance with section 18a or 18b and does not change jobs.

(6) In derogation from section 8 (1), the minimum salary level referred to in subsection (1) sentence 2 applies when extending an EU Blue Card if the applicant acquired a higher education qualification or qualification from a tertiary programme of education which is equivalent to higher education studies no more than three years prior to applying for the extension of the EU Blue Card, or if fewer than 24 months have elapsed since the first EU Blue Card was granted in accordance with subsection (1) sentence 2 no. 2. In all other cases, section 8 (1) remains unaffected.

(7) The Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community announces the minimum salaries referred to in subsections (1) and (2) in the Federal Gazette for each calendar year by 31 December for the following year.

Section 18h  
Short-term mobility for holders of an EU Blue Card

(1) In derogation from section 4 (1), holders of a valid EU Blue Card issued by another member state of the European Union do not need a residence title or a work permit from the Federal Employment Agency to enter and stay for the purpose of conducting business activities which are directly related to their obligations stated in the work contract on the basis of which the EU Blue Card was granted if their stay does not exceed 90 days within a 180-day period. If the EU Blue Card was issued by a member state of the European Union that is not a Schengen state, in addition to the EU Blue Card, the foreigner must have evidence of the business purpose of the stay and present it on request during the border check.

(2) Subsection (1) applies accordingly if the foreigner has the legal status of a long-term resident in another member state of the European Union and immediately before acquiring this status possessed an EU Blue Card issued by that member state.

Section 18i  
Long-term mobility for holders of an EU Blue Card

(1) A foreigner who possesses a valid EU Blue Card granted by another member state of the European Union and has legally resided in that member state for at least 12 months by virtue of that EU Blue Card is granted an EU Blue Card pursuant to section 18g if the requirements of section 18g are met.

(2) If a member state of the European Union which is not a Schengen state issued the EU Blue Card in accordance with subsection (1) sentence 1 first half-sentence, in addition to the valid EU Blue Card, the foreigner must have a work contract or a binding job offer commensurate with his or her qualification at the level of a higher education qualification or a qualification from a tertiary programme of education which is equivalent to higher education studies which meets all the requirements of section 18g (1) sentence 5 and must keep the work contract or binding offer with him or her for at least six months in the federal territory.

(3) If the foreigner has already made use of the option of long-term mobility pursuant to Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2021/1883 one or more times, the minimum length of legal residence in another member state of the European Union using a valid EU Blue Card issued by that member state is, in derogation from subsection (1) sentence 1, six months.

Section 19  
ICT Card for intra-corporate transferees

(1) An ICT Card is a residence title for the purpose of an intra-corporate transfer of a foreigner. An intra-corporate transfer is the temporary secondment of a foreigner

1.  to a national entity belonging to the undertaking by which the foreigner is employed, if the undertaking is located outside the European Union, or

2.  to a national entity of another undertaking of the group of undertakings to which the undertaking located outside the European Union belongs and by which the foreigner is employed.

(2) A foreigner is granted an ICT Card if

1.  the foreigner will work as a manager or specialist in the host entity,

2.  the foreigner has been employed by the undertaking or group of undertakings for at least six months immediately prior to the transfer and will be employed without interruption by the undertaking or group of undertakings during the transfer period,

3.  the intra-corporate transfer will exceed 90 days,

4.  the foreigner provides a work contract valid for the duration of the intra-corporate transfer and, if necessary, an assignment letter stating

a)  specific information regarding the place and kind of work, remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment during the intra-corporate transfer, as well as

b)  evidence that the foreigner will be able to return to an entity belonging to the same undertaking or group of undertakings established outside the European Union after completing the intra-corporate transfer, and

5.  the foreigner provides evidence of his or her occupational qualifications.

A manager within the meaning of this Act is a person holding a senior position, who primarily directs the management of the host entity, receiving general supervision or guidance principally from the board of directors or shareholders of the business or equivalent. This position includes directing the host entity or a department or subdivision of the host entity; supervising and monitoring work of the other supervisory, professional or managerial employees; and having the authority to recommend hiring, dismissing or other personnel action. A specialist within the meaning of this Act is a person who possesses specialised knowledge essential to the host entity's areas of activity, techniques or management, a high level of qualification and appropriate professional experience.

(3) A foreigner is granted an ICT Card also if

1.  the foreigner will work as a trainee employee in the context of an intra-corporate transfer, and

2.  the conditions referred to in subsection (2) sentence 1 nos. 2 to 4 are met.

A trainee employee within the meaning of this Act is a person with a higher education qualification completing a traineeship for career development purposes or in order to obtain training in business techniques or methods, and is paid during the transfer.

(4) The ICT Card is granted

1.  for the duration of the transfer but no more than three years, for managers and specialists,

2.  for the duration of the transfer but no more than one year, for trainee employees.

The maximum periods stipulated in sentence 1 may not be exceeded by extending the ICT Card.

(5) The ICT Card is not granted to foreigners who

1.  owing to treaties between the European Union and its member states on the one hand and third countries on the other, enjoy rights of free movement equivalent to those of Union citizens,

2.  are employed by an undertaking located in one of those third countries, or

3.  are completing a training programme as part of their studies.

(6) Furthermore, the ICT Card is not granted if

1.  the host entity was established for the main purpose of facilitating the entry of intra-corporate transferees,

2.  the foreigner, in the context of the possible entry and stay in several member states of the European Union will spend more time in another member state than in the federal territory during the transfer, or

3.  the application is filed within six months of the end of the foreigner’s last stay in the federal territory for the purpose of an intra-corporate transfer.

(7) This provision serves to implement Directive 2014/66/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals in the framework of an intra-corporate transfer (OJ L 157, 27.5.2014, p. 1).

Section 19a  
Short-term mobility for intra-corporate transferees

(1) In derogation from section 4 (1), a foreigner is not required to have a residence title for stays for intra-corporate transfers not exceeding 90 days within a 180-day period, provided the host entity in the other member state has notified the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees and the competent authority of the other member state that the foreigner intends to take up employment in the federal territory, submitting the following at the same time:

1.  evidence that the foreigner possesses a valid residence title issued by another member state of the European Union in accordance with Directive 2014/66/EU,

2.  evidence that the national host entity belongs to the same undertaking or group of undertakings as the undertaking established outside the European Union by which the foreigner is employed,

3.  a work contract or, if necessary, an assignment letter as stipulated in section 19 (2) sentence 1 no. 4, which have already been presented to the competent authorities of the other member state, and

4.  a copy of the foreigner’s recognised and valid passport or passport substitute,

5.  evidence that permission to work in an occupation has been granted or promised, if necessary.

The host entity must make the notification when the foreigner applies for a residence title in the scope of Directive 2014/66/EU in another member state of the European Union. If, at the time of application, the host entity in the other member state is not yet aware of the foreigner’s intention to be transferred to an entity in the federal territory, it is to make the notification as soon as it becomes aware of this intention. If the residence title pursuant to sentence 1 no. 1 has been issued by a non-Schengen state, and if the foreigner enters the federal territory via a non-Schengen state, the foreigner must carry a copy of the notification and present it to the competent authorities at their request.

(2) If the notification was made at the time referred to in subsection (1) sentence 2, and if the foreigner has not been denied entry and residence under subsection (4), the foreigner may enter the federal territory at any time during the validity of the residence title issued by the other member state as referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 1 and stay there for the purpose of the intra-corporate transfer. If the notification was made at the time referred to in subsection (1) sentence 3, the foreigner may enter the federal territory at any time after the notification is received and during the validity of the residence title issued by the other member state as referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 1 and stay there for the purpose of the intra-corporate transfer.

(3) The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees denies the foreigner entry and residence if

1.  the remuneration the foreigner will be granted during the intra-corporate transfer is less favourable than that granted to comparable German employees,

2.  the conditions of subsection (1) sentence 1 nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5 are not met,

3.  the documents presented pursuant to subsection (1) were fraudulently acquired, falsified or tampered with,

4.  the foreigner has been staying in the European Union for more than three years, or, in the case of a trainee employee, for more than a year, or

5.  there is a public interest in expelling the foreigner.

In the cases covered by sentence 1 nos. 1 to 4, entry and residence are to be denied no later than 20 days after the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees receives the complete information pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1. In cases covered by sentence 1 no. 5, the foreigners authority may deny entry and residence at any time during the foreigner’s stay; section 73 (3c) applies accordingly. The foreigner and the competent authority of the other member state as well as the host entity in the other member state are to be informed of the denial. Where entry and residence are denied within the allotted time, the foreigner must cease the economic activity without delay; the exemption from the obligation to hold a residence title pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 ceases to exist.

(4) If, within 20 days of receiving the notification referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1, the foreigner has not been denied entry and residence in accordance with subsection (3), the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees is to issue the foreigner with a certificate confirming the entitlement to enter and stay in the federal territory for the purpose of an intra-corporate transfer in the context of short-term mobility.

(5) Once a foreigner has been denied entry and residence under subsection (3) or the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees has issued a certificate within the meaning of subsection (4), responsibility for further measures and decisions under residence law rests with the foreigners authority, as set out in section 71 (1). The foreigner must inform the foreigners authority without delay if the other member state extends the residence title in accordance with subsection sentence 1 no. 1.

Section 20a  
Opportunity card; authorisation to issue statutory instruments

(1) An opportunity card (Chancenkarte) is a temporary residence permit granted for the purpose of seeking employment or following measures regarding the recognition of foreign occupational qualifications.

(2) Holders of an opportunity card are entitled

1.  to pursue employment of up to 20 hours per week and

2.  take up trial employment for up to two weeks, on the condition that

a)  it is skilled employment,

b)  it aims at vocational training or

c)  it can be taken up as part of a measure to recognise foreign occupational qualifications pursuant to section 16d.

(3) Foreigners may be granted an opportunity card, if

1.  they are skilled workers or

2.  they scored enough points related to the features required by section 20b (1) as listed in the table annexed to this act.

(4) However, the opportunity card may only be granted if the foreigner’s subsistence is secured. Foreigners already residing in the federal territory may only be granted an opportunity card if they possess a residence title pursuant to Division 3 or 4. An opportunity card as referred to in subsection (3) no. 2 may only be granted if the foreigner

1.  either

a)  has a foreign occupational qualification

aa)  which is officially recognised by the country where it was acquired and

bb)  which can only be acquired after completing training which takes at least two years, or

b)  holds a foreign higher education qualification which is officially recognised in the country where it was acquired, or

c)  has acquired a vocational qualification abroad by completing training whose content, duration and manner of execution meet the requirements of the Vocational Training Act (_Berufsbildungsgesetz_) and which is suited to enable the foreigner to work in an occupation with regulated training as defined in the Vocational Training Act or the Crafts Code (_Handwerksordnung_), with the qualification being granted by a German chamber of commerce abroad, and

2.  the foreigner

a)  demonstrates at least basic knowledge of the German language, or

b)  demonstrates English language skills corresponding at least to Level B2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

The foreigner is required to obtain confirmation from a competent German authority that he or she fulfils the prerequisites of sentence 3 no. 1 (a) or (b). The fact that the training abroad meets the requirements stipulated in sentence 3 no. 1 (c) is to be confirmed vis-à-vis the body granting the qualification upon its application and at its expense.

(5) Opportunity cards are granted for an initial period of up to one year (opportunity card for job searches, _Such-Chancenkarte_). The opportunity card may be extended by up to two years on account of an application filed during a stay under sentence 1, if the foreigner has an employment contract or a binding job offer for skilled employment in Germany and the Federal Employment Agency has given its consent (follow-up opportunity card, _Folge-Chancenkarte_). A follow-up opportunity card is only granted if the foreigner does not meet the requirements of other types of residence permits under Division 4. As long as the decision on the extension is pending, section 81 (4) applies to the extension of a follow-up opportunity card and the future employment, with the proviso that the foreigner concerned may only engage in the future employment referred to in sentence 2. Subsection (2) does not apply to the follow-up opportunity card.

The card may not be extended as an opportunity card beyond the period stipulated in sentence 2. An opportunity card for job searches may only be issued anew if the foreigner, after the expiry of the last opportunity card for job searches, stayed abroad for at least as long as he or she stayed in the federal territory on the basis of an opportunity card for job searches.

(6) Section 9 does not apply in the cases covered by subsection (5) sentence 1.

(7) In order to manage labour migration, the Federal Government is authorised to issue statutory instruments not requiring the approval of the Bundesrat to restrict, annually or for shorter periods, the number of opportunity cards granted to foreigners not yet staying in the federal territory. As a rule, such restrictions are to take into account labour market and integration policy considerations and the capacities of the authorities involved.

b)  for being granted permission to work in an occupation which is regulated in Germany,

10.  if they are aged between 35 and 40 when applying for the opportunity card,

11.  if they have resided lawfully in the federal territory for a continuous period of at least six months in the last five years; minor interruptions have no negative consequences provided that, overall, the person’s place of residence can be deemed to have mainly been in Germany, and

12.  if the foreigner's spouse or registered civil partner meets the requirements for being granted an opportunity card, applies or has applied for an opportunity card at the same time as the foreigner, will enter or intends to enter Germany together with the foreigner, and if the foreigner refers in his or her application to the specific application filed or to be filed by the spouse or registered civil partner.

If foreigners are awarded points under sentence 1 no. 1, the requirements for being granted an opportunity card mentioned in section 20a (4) sentence 3 no. 1 cease to apply.

(2) The points awarded for the features mentioned in subsection (1) sentence 1 are listed in the table annexed to this act. The requirement of section 20a (3) no. 2 is met if a foreigner is awarded the minimum number of points mentioned in the table.

(3) In order to manage labour migration under the points-based system referred to in section 20a (3) no. 2 and subsections (1) and (2), the Federal Government is authorised to issue statutory instruments not requiring the approval of the Bundesrat to amend the table annexed to this act as regards the points awarded for specific features under subsection (1) and as regards the minimum number of points required to meet the requirement stipulated in section 20a (3) no. 2.

Section 21  
Self-employment

(1) A foreigner may be granted a temporary residence permit for the purpose of self-employment if

1.  an economic interest or a regional need applies,

2.  the activity is expected to have positive effects on the economy and

3.  personal capital on the part of the foreigner or a loan undertaking is available to realise the business idea. Assessment of the conditions in sentence 1 focuses in particular on the viability of the business idea on which the application is based, the foreigner’s entrepreneurial experience, the level of capital investment, the effects on the employment and training situation and the contribution to innovation and research. The competent bodies for the planned business location, the competent trade and industry authorities, the representative bodies for public-sector occupational groups and the competent authorities regulating admission to the occupation concerned are to be involved in examining the application.

(2) A temporary residence permit for the purpose of self-employment may also be granted if special privileges apply according to agreements under international law on the basis of reciprocity.

(2a) A foreigner who has successfully completed studies at a state or state-recognised university or a comparable educational institution in the federal territory or who holds a temporary residence permit as a researcher or scientist in accordance with sections 18b, 18d, 19c (1) or an EU Blue Card is, as a general rule, to be issued a temporary residence permit for self-employment purposes in derogation from subsection (1). The envisaged self-employment must demonstrate a connection to the knowledge acquired during the higher education studies or the research or scientific activities.

(2b) Foreigners may be granted a temporary residence permit for the purpose of starting a business if

1.  they are skilled workers and

2.  a German scientific organisation or a German public body has granted them a scholarship from public funds which secures subsistence to prepare for starting a business.

The temporary residence permit is granted for the duration of the scholarship, but not for more than 18 months.

(3) As a general rule, foreigners older than 45 are to be granted a temporary residence permit only if they possess adequate provision for old age.

(4) The period of validity of the temporary residence permit is limited to a maximum of three years. In derogation from section 9 (2), a permanent settlement permit may be issued after three years, if the foreigner has been self-employed for three years and the current activity, based in particular on its success and duration, gives reason to expect that the business will continue, if adequate income ensures the subsistence of the foreigner and the dependants living with him or her as a family unit and whom he or she is required to support, and if the requirements of section 9 (2) sentence 1 no. 4 are met.

(5) In derogation from subsection (1), a foreigner may be granted a temporary residence permit for the purpose of self-employment.

Subsection (4) does not apply.

(6) A foreigner who will be or has been granted a temporary residence permit for another purpose may be permitted to pursue self-employment while retaining the aforesaid purpose of residence, if the permits required pursuant to other provisions have been issued or the authorities have indicated that such permits will be issued.

Admission from abroad

A foreigner may be granted a temporary residence permit for the purpose of admission from abroad for reasons of international law or on urgent humanitarian grounds.

Section 23  
Granting of residence by the supreme Land authorities; admission when special political interests apply; resettling persons seeking protection

(1) The supreme _Land_ authority may order a temporary residence permit to be granted to foreigners from specific states or to certain groups of foreigners defined by other means, for reasons of international law, on humanitarian grounds or in order to uphold the political interests of the Federal Republic of Germany. The order may be issued subject to the proviso that a declaration of commitment be submitted in accordance with section 68. In order to ensure a nationwide uniform approach, the order requires the approval of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community. The residence permit does not entitle the holder to pursue an economic activity; the order may stipulate that the temporary residence permit to be granted allows such activity or that such activity may be permitted under section 4a (1).

(2) In order to safeguard special political interests of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community may, in consultation with the supreme _Land_ authorities, order the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees to grant foreigners from specific states or certain categories of foreigners defined by other means approval for admission. No preliminary proceedings take place pursuant to section 68 of the Code of Administrative Court Procedure (_Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung_). The foreigners concerned are to be granted a temporary residence permit or permanent settlement permit, in accordance with the approval for admission. The permanent settlement permit may be issued subject to a restriction on the permissible place of residence.

(3) The order may provide for section 24 to be applied accordingly, either in part or in full.

(4) In consultation with the supreme _Land_ authorities, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community may, within the context of resettling persons seeking protection, order the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees to grant approval for admission to certain persons seeking protection who have been selected for resettlement (resettlement refugees).

Section 23a  
Granting residence in case of hardship

(1) In derogation from the prerequisites for granting and extending residence titles as stipulated in this Act as well as in sections 10 and 11, the supreme _Land_ authority may, on petition from a hardship commission established by the _Land_ government by virtue of a statutory instrument, order a temporary residence permit to be issued to a foreigner who is enforceably required to leave the federal territory (hardship petition). According to the individual case concerned, the said order may be issued with due consideration as to whether the foreigner’s subsistence is ensured or a declaration of commitment is submitted in accordance with section 68. A case of hardship will not generally be considered if the foreigner has committed a serious offence or if a concrete date has already been set for the foreigner’s removal. The authority to grant residence represents the public interest only and does not constitute any rights on the part of the foreigner.

(2) The _Land_ governments are authorised to establish a hardship commission in accordance with subsection (1) by virtue of a statutory instrument, to specify the procedure, grounds for exclusion and qualified requirements pertaining to a declaration of commitment pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2, including conditions to be met by the party submitting such a declaration, and to assign the authority to issue orders pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 to other bodies. The hardship commissions take action solely on their own initiative. No third parties may require a hardship commission to take up a specific individual case or to make a specific decision. A hardship commission may decide to file a hardship petition only after establishing that urgent humanitarian or personal grounds justify the foreigner’s continued presence in the federal territory.

(3) If a foreigner who is dependent on social welfare and who has been issued a temporary residence permit in accordance with subsection (1) relocates to the area of responsibility of another institution, the social welfare institution in whose area of responsibility a foreigners authority has issued the temporary residence permit is required to reimburse the costs incurred by the local social welfare institution which now bears responsibility for the foreigner concerned for a maximum of three years from the date the temporary residence permit was issued. The same applies accordingly to the subsistence payments stipulated in section 6 (1) sentence 1 no. 2 of Book Two of the Social Code.

Section 24  
Granting residence for temporary protection

(1) A foreigner who is granted temporary protection on the basis of a decision by the Council of the European Union pursuant to Directive 2001/55/EC and who declares the willingness to be admitted into the federal territory is granted a temporary residence permit for the duration of the temporary protection as assessed in accordance with Articles 4 and 6 of said directive.

(2) No temporary protection is granted if the conditions stipulated in section 3 (2) of the Asylum Act or section 60 (8) sentence 1 apply; the temporary residence permit is to be denied.

(3) The foreigners referred to in subsection (1) are allocated to the various _Länder_. The _Länder_ may agree quotas for admission to grant temporary protection and for allocation. Allocation to the various _Länder_ is carried out by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. Unless another formula for allocation has been agreed among the _Länder_, the formula for the allocation of asylum applicants applies.

(4) The supreme _Land_ authority of the _Land_ to which the foreigner has been allocated under subsection (3) or the body designated by it may issue an allocation decision. The _Land_ governments are authorised to regulate allocation within the _Länder_ via statutory instruments, and may assign this authority to other bodies via statutory instruments; section 50 (4) of the Asylum Act applies accordingly. The allocation decision is not contestable. Any legal actions have no suspensive effect. The allocation decision expires when a temporary residence permit is issued in accordance with subsection (1).

(5) The foreigner has no entitlement to stay in a specific _Land_ or a specific place. The foreigner must take up accommodation and habitual residence at the place to which he or she is allocated in accordance with subsections (3) and (4).

Section 25  
Residence on humanitarian grounds

(1) Foreigners are granted a temporary residence permit if they are recognised as being entitled to asylum. This does not apply to foreigners who are subject to expulsion under the conditions of section 53 (3a). Residence is deemed to be permitted up to the time the temporary residence permit is issued.

(2) A foreigner is to be granted a temporary residence permit if the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees has granted him or her refugee status within the meaning of section 3 (1) of the Asylum Act or subsidiary protection status within the meaning of section 4 (1) of the Asylum Act. Subsection (1) sentences 2 to 3 applies accordingly.

(3) As a general rule, a foreigner is to be granted a temporary residence permit if a deportation ban applies pursuant to section 60 (5) or (7). The temporary residence permit is not granted if departure for subsequent admission to another state is possible and reasonable or the foreigner has repeatedly or grossly breached the obligation to cooperate. Further, it is not granted where there is serious reason to believe that the foreigner

1.  has committed a crime against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity within the meaning of the international instruments which have been drawn up for the purpose of establishing provisions regarding such crimes,

2.  has committed a serious criminal offence,

3.  is guilty of acts contrary to the objectives and principles of the United Nations, as enshrined in the Preamble and Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter of the United Nations, or

4.  represents a threat to the general public or a threat to the security of the Federal Republic of Germany.

(4) A foreigner who is not enforceably required to leave the federal territory may be granted a temporary residence permit for a temporary stay if the foreigner’s continued presence in the federal territory is necessary on urgent humanitarian or personal grounds or due to substantial public interests. In derogation from section 8 (1) and (2), a temporary residence permit may be extended if departure from the federal territory would constitute exceptional hardship for the foreigner due to special circumstances in the individual case concerned. The residence permit does not entitle the holder to pursue an economic activity; such activity may be permitted under section 4a (1).

(4a) As a general rule, a foreigner who has been the victim of a criminal offence under sections 232 to 233a of the Criminal Code (_Strafgesetzbuch_) is also to be granted a temporary residence permit for a temporary stay, even if the foreigner is enforceably required to leave the federal territory. The temporary residence permit may only be issued if

1.  the public prosecutor’s office or the criminal court considers the foreigner’s presence in the federal territory to be appropriate in connection with criminal proceedings relating to the said criminal offence, because it would be more difficult to investigate the facts of the case without the foreigner’s information,

2.  the foreigner has broken off contact to the persons accused of having committed the criminal offence and

3.  the foreigner has declared the willingness to testify as a witness in the criminal proceedings relating to the offence.

After the criminal proceedings have ended, the temporary residence permit is to be extended as a rule if humanitarian or personal reasons or public interests require the foreigner’s further presence in the federal territory. The residence permit does not entitle the holder to pursue an economic activity; such activity may be permitted under section 4a (1).

(4b) A foreigner who has been the victim of a criminal offence pursuant to sections 10 (1) or 11 (1) no. 3 of the Act to Combat Clandestine Employment (_Schwarzarbeitsbekämpfungsgesetz_) or pursuant to section 15a of the Act on Temporary Employment Businesses (_Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz_) may also be granted a temporary residence permit for a temporary stay, even if the foreigner is enforceably required to leave the federal territory. The temporary residence permit may only be issued if

1.  the public prosecutor’s office or the criminal court considers the temporary presence of the foreigner in the federal territory to be appropriate in connection with criminal proceedings relating to the said criminal offence, because it would be more difficult to investigate the facts of the case without the foreigner’s information and

2.  the foreigner has declared the willingness to testify as a witness in the criminal proceedings relating to the offence.

The temporary residence permit may be extended if the remuneration owed to the foreigner by the employer has not yet been paid in full, and it would represent particular hardship for the foreigner to pursue his or her claim from abroad. The temporary residence permit does not entitle the holder to pursue an economic activity; such activity may be permitted under section 4a (1).

(5) A foreigner who is enforceably required to leave the federal territory may be granted a temporary residence permit if departure is impossible in fact or in law and the obstacles to departure are not likely to be removed in the foreseeable future. As a general rule, the temporary residence permit is to be granted if deportation has been suspended for 18 months. A temporary residence permit may only be granted if the foreigner is prevented from leaving the federal territory through no fault of his or her own. Fault on the part of the foreigner applies in particular if he or she furnishes false information, deceives the authorities with regard to his or her identity or nationality or fails to meet reasonable demands to eliminate the obstacles to departure.

Section 25a  
Granting residence in the case of well-integrated juveniles and young adults

(1) A foreign juvenile or foreign young adult who has reached the age of legal majority and has a temporary residence permit under section 104c or has been granted a temporary suspension of deportation is as a general rule to be granted a temporary residence permit if

1.  the foreigner has resided in the federal territory for three years without interruption on the basis of a temporary residence or permanent settlement permit, of a temporary suspension of deportation, or of permission to remain pending the asylum decision,

2.  the foreigner has successfully attended school in the federal territory as a rule for three years or has acquired a recognised vocational or school-leaving qualification, These requirements are waived if the foreigner is unable to fulfil them on account of a physical or mental illness or disability,

3.  the application for the temporary residence permit is filed before the foreigner reaches the age of 27,

4.  it appears, on the basis of the foreigner’s education and way of life to date, that the foreigner will be able to become integrated in the way of life in the Federal Republic of Germany and

5.  there is no concrete evidence to suggest that the foreigner is not committed to the free democratic basic order of the Federal Republic of Germany.

For as long as the foreign juvenile or young adult attends school, vocational training or higher education, claiming public benefits for the purpose of ensuring his or her subsistence does not preclude the granting of the temporary residence permit. A temporary residence permit is to be denied if deportation has been suspended on the basis of false information furnished by the foreigner or on the grounds of deception by the foreigner as to his or her identity or nationality.

(2) The parents or parent having the right of care and custody of a foreign minor who holds a temporary residence permit in accordance with subsection (1) may be granted a temporary residence permit if

1.  deportation has not been prevented or delayed on the grounds of false information or deceit with regard to identity or nationality or due to a failure to meet reasonable demands to eliminate obstacles to departure and

2.  subsistence is ensured independently by means of an economic activity.

The minor children of a foreigner who holds a temporary residence permit pursuant to sentence 1 may be granted temporary residence permits if they live with the foreigner as a family unit. As a general rule, a spouse or civil partner who is living with the beneficiary referred to in subsection (1) as a family unit is to be granted a temporary residence permit if the conditions of sentence 1 are met. Section 31 applies accordingly. As a general rule, a minor unmarried child who is living with the beneficiary referred to in subsection (1) as a family unit is to be granted a temporary residence permit.

(3) No temporary residence permit pursuant to subsection (2) may be granted if the foreigner has been convicted of an offence intentionally committed in the federal territory; fines totalling up to 50 daily rates or up to 90 daily rates in the case of offences which, pursuant to this Act or the Asylum Act, can only be committed by foreigners, are ignored as a general principle.

(4) The temporary residence permit may be granted in derogation from section 10 (3) sentence 2.

(5) If the foreigner has a temporary residence permit under section 104c, the time periods referred to in section 60b (b) (5) sentence 1 are also to be counted when applying subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 1.

(6) A foreigner who has a temporary residence permit under section 104c is, as a general rule, only to be granted a temporary residence permit under subsection (1) if the requirements of section 5 (1) no. 1a are met. If the foreigner has undertaken the necessary and reasonable measures to verify his or her identity, the temporary residence permit may be granted in derogation from sentence 1.

Section 25b  
Granting residence in the case of permanent integration

(1) In derogation from section 5 (1) no. 1 and (2), a foreigner whose deportation has been suspended or who has a temporary residence permit under section 104c is as a rule to be granted a temporary residence permit if the foreigner has become permanently integrated into the way of life in the Federal Republic of Germany. As a rule, this is subject to the condition that the foreigner

1.  has resided in the federal territory for at least six years or, if the foreigner is living with a minor unmarried child as a family unit, for at least four years without interruption on the basis of a temporary suspension of deportation, on the basis of permission to remain pending the asylum decision or by holding a temporary residence permit,

2.  is committed to the free democratic basic order of the Federal Republic of Germany and possesses a basic knowledge of the legal and social system and the way of life which prevails in the federal territory,

3.  ensures his or her subsistence primarily by pursuing an economic activity or it is to be expected, when considering the foreigner’s previous educational, training, income and family situation, that the foreigner will be able to ensure his or her subsistence within the meaning of section 2 (3); receiving housing benefits is not detrimental thereto,

4.  possesses an elementary oral command of the German language equivalent to Level A2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and

5.  can furnish proof that his or her school-age children are actually attending school.

Temporarily receiving social benefits is not generally detrimental to securing subsistence in the case of

1.  students attending a state or state-recognised higher education institution and apprentices undergoing training in a recognised trade or in a government-sponsored pre-vocational training measure,

2.  families with minor children who temporarily rely on supplementary social benefits,

3.  single parents of minor children who, pursuant to section 10 (1) no. 3 of Book Two of the Social Code, cannot reasonably be expected to take up employment or

4.  foreigners caring for close relatives in need of long-term care.

(2) A temporary residence permit pursuant to subsection (1) is to be denied where

1.  the foreigner prevents or delays the termination of his or her residence by intentionally providing false information, by deceit regarding his or her identity or nationality, or non-compliance with reasonable requirements to cooperate in eliminating any obstacles to the departure or

2.  there is a public interest in expelling the foreigner within the meaning of section 54 (1) or (2) nos.1 and 2.

(3) The conditions of subsection (1) sentence 2, nos. 3 and 4 are waived if the foreigner is unable to fulfil them due to a physical or mental illness or disability or old age.

(4) As a general rule, a spouse, civil partner and minor unmarried children living with the beneficiary referred to in subsection (1) as a family unit are to be granted a temporary residence permit under the conditions set out in subsection (1) sentence 2 nos. 2 to 5. Subsections (2), (3) and 5 apply. Section 31 applies accordingly.

(5) In derogation from section 26 (1) sentence 1, the temporary residence permit is to be granted and extended for no more than two years. It may be granted in derogation from section 10 (3) sentence 2. Section 25a remains unaffected.

(6) As a general rule, a foreigner, his or her spouse or civil partner and minor unmarried children living with the foreigner as a family unit who have held a card documenting suspended deportation under section 60d for 30 months, are to be granted a temporary residence permit in accordance with subsection (1) in derogation from the time limit referred to in subsection (1) sentence 2 no. 1, if the requirements of section 60d are met and the foreigner has an elementary oral command of the German language; if the foreigner had the possibility to attend an integration course, the temporary residence permit is granted on the further condition that the foreigner, the spouse or civil partner also have an elementary written command of the German language.

(7) If the foreigner has a temporary residence permit under section 104c, the time periods referred to in section 60b (5) sentence 1 are also to be counted when applying subsection (1) sentence 2 no. 1.

(8) A foreigner who has a temporary residence permit under section 104c is, as a general rule, only to be granted a temporary residence permit under subsection (1) if the requirements of section 5 (1) no. 1a are met. If the foreigner has undertaken the necessary and reasonable measures to verify his or her identity, the temporary residence permit may be granted in derogation from sentence 1.

1.  the foreigner has possessed a temporary residence permit for five years; in derogation from section 55 (3) of the Asylum Act, the period of residence during the asylum procedure which preceded the issuance of the temporary residence permit is counted towards the period in which the foreigner is required to possess a temporary residence permit in order to be issued with a permanent settlement permit,

Section 31  
Independent right of residence for spouses

(1) If marital cohabitation ends, the spouse’s temporary residence permit is extended by one year as an independent right of residence unrelated to the purpose of the subsequent immigration of dependants if

1.  marital cohabitation has lawfully existed in the federal territory for at least three years or

2.  the foreigner has died during marital cohabitation in the federal territory

and the foreigner possessed a temporary residence permit, permanent settlement permit or EU long-term residence permit up to that time, unless the foreigner was unable to apply for an extension in time for reasons beyond his or her control. Sentence 1 does not apply if the foreigner’s temporary residence permit may not be extended or if the foreigner may not be granted a temporary residence permit or EU long-term residence permit because this is precluded by a rule of law on account of the purpose of residence or by an ancillary provision attaching to the temporary residence permit pursuant to section 8 (2).

(1a) If the foreigner has an EU Blue Card, subsection (1) applies to the foreigner’s spouse subject to the proviso that the time period referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 1 is also deemed to have been fulfilled if marital cohabitation has lawfully existed for at least two years in the federal territory and before that for at least one year in another member state of the European Union.

(2) The requirement in subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 1 for marital cohabitation to have existed lawfully for three years in the federal territory or lawfully for two years in the federal territory in accordance with subsection (1a) is to be waived if necessary to enable the spouse to continue his or her residence in order to avoid particular hardship, unless an extension of the foreigner’s temporary residence permit is not permitted. Particular hardship is deemed to apply especially if the marriage is not valid or has been suspended under German law because the spouse was a minor when he or she married, if the obligation to return to the country of origin resulting from the termination of marital cohabitation threatens to substantially harm the foreigner’s legitimate interests, or if continuing marital cohabitation is unreasonable due to the harm to the foreigner’s legitimate interests; in particular this is to be assumed if the spouse is the victim of domestic violence. Such legitimate interests also include the well-being of a child living with the spouse as part of a family unit. In order to avoid abuse, extension of the temporary residence permit may be denied if the spouse relies on benefits under Book Two or Book Twelve of the Social Code for reasons for which he or she is responsible.

(3) In derogation from section 9 (2) sentence 1 nos. 3, 5 and 6 the spouse is also to be granted a permanent settlement permit if the spouse’s subsistence is ensured after the termination of marital cohabitation by maintenance payments from the foreigner’s own funds and the foreigner possesses a permanent settlement permit or an EU long-term residence permit.

(4) Without prejudice to subsection (2) sentence 4, claiming benefits under Book Two or Book Twelve of the Social Code does not preclude extension of the temporary residence permit. The temporary residence permit may thus be extended as long as the conditions for granting the permanent settlement permit or EU long-term residence permit have not been met.

Section 32  
Subsequent immigration of children

(1) The minor unmarried child of a foreigner is to be granted a temporary residence permit if the parents or the parent having the sole right of care and custody hold one of the following residence titles:

1.  a temporary residence permit in accordance with section 7 (1) sentence 3 or Divisions 3 or 4,

2.  a temporary residence permit in accordance with section 25 (1) or (2) sentence 1 first alternative,

3.  a temporary residence permit in accordance with sections 28, 30, 31, 36 or 36a,

5.  an EU Blue Card, an ICT Card, a Mobile ICT Card, a permanent settlement permit or

6.  an EU long-term residence permit.

(2) If the minor unmarried child is aged 16 or over and if he or she does not relocate the main ordinary residence to Germany together with his or her parents or the parent possessing the sole right of care and custody, subsection (1) only applies if the child speaks German or if it appears, on the basis of his or her education and way of life to date, that he or she will be able to integrate into the way of life in the Federal Republic of Germany. Sentence 1 does not apply if

1.  the foreigner possesses a temporary residence permit in accordance with section 23 (4), section 25 (1) or (2), a permanent settlement permit in accordance with section 26 (3) or possesses a permanent settlement permit in accordance with section 26 (4) after being granted a temporary residence permit in accordance with section 25 (2) sentence 1 second alternative,

2.  the foreigner or the spouse living with him or her as a family unit has a permanent settlement permit in accordance with section 18c (3), an EU Blue Card, an ICT Card, a Mobile ICT Card or a temporary residence permit in accordance with sections 18a, 18b, 18d, 18f, 19c (1) for employment as an executive, manager, business specialist, academic, visiting academic, engineer or technician in a research team of a visiting academic or as teaching staff, section 19c (2) or (4) sentence 1 or section 21, or

3.  the foreigner or the spouse living with him or her as a family unit was the holder of an EU Blue Card or a temporary residence permit in accordance with sections 18a, 18b, 18d, 19c (1) for employment as an executive, manager, business specialist, academic, visiting academic, engineer or technician in a research team of a visiting academic or as teaching staff, section 19c (2) or (4) sentence 1 or section 21, immediately before being granted a permanent settlement permit or an EU long-term residence permit.

(3) As a general rule, where parents share the right of care and custody, a temporary residence permit pursuant to subsections (1) or (2) is also to be granted for the purpose of joining just one parent, if the other parent has consented to the child’s residence in Germany or if a competent authority has reached a legally binding decision to this effect.

(4) In all other cases, a minor unmarried child of a foreigner may be granted a temporary residence permit if necessary to prevent special hardship on account of the circumstances in the individual case concerned. The child’s well-being and the family situation are be taken into consideration. Section 36a applies to minor, unmarried children of foreigners who possess a temporary residence permit in accordance with section 25 (2) sentence 1 second alternative

(5) If the foreigner is entitled to stay in the federal territory pursuant to section 18e, the minor unmarried child does not need a residence title if it has been established that the child stayed in the other member state of the European Union lawfully as the foreigner’s dependant. The requirements stipulated in section 18e (1) sentence 1 nos. 1, 3 and 4, and the grounds for rejection pursuant to section 19f apply accordingly to the minor child.

Section 33  
Children born in the federal territory

In derogation from sections 5 and 29 (1) no. 2, a child who is born in the federal territory may be granted a temporary residence permit ex officio if one parent possesses a temporary residence permit, permanent settlement permit or EU long-term residence permit. Where both parents or the parent possessing sole right of care and custody hold a temporary residence permit, a permanent settlement permit or an EU long-term residence permit at the time of their child's birth, the child born in the federal territory is granted a temporary residence permit ex officio. A child born in the federal territory whose mother or father possesses a visa or is permitted to stay in the federal territory without a visa at the time of the child's birth is permitted to stay in the federal territory until the visa or the lawful period of stay without a visa expires.

Section 34  
Children’s right of residence

(1) In derogation from section 5 (1) no. 1 and section 29 (1) no. 2, the temporary residence permit granted to a child is to be extended as long as a parent possessing the right of care and custody holds a temporary residence permit, permanent settlement permit or EU long-term residence permit and the child lives together with the said parent as part of a family unit, or if the child would have a right of return pursuant to section 37 if he or she left the federal territory.

(2) When a child comes of age, the temporary residence permit granted to the child becomes an independent right of residence which is unrelated to the purpose of the subsequent immigration of dependants. The same applies to the granting of a permanent settlement permit and an EU long-term residence permit or if the temporary residence permit is extended accordingly under section 37.

(3) The temporary residence permit may be extended as long as the conditions for granting the permanent settlement permit and the EU long-term residence permit have not yet been met.

(1) In derogation from section 9 (2), a foreign minor who has a temporary residence permit in accordance with this Division is to be granted a permanent settlement permit if he or she has had the temporary residence permit for five years on reaching the age of 16. The same applies if

1.  the foreigner is of age and has been in possession of the temporary residence permit for five years,

2.  the foreigner has a sufficient command of the German language, and

3.  the foreigner’s subsistence is ensured or he or she is in education or training which leads to a recognised school, vocational or higher education qualification.

1.  there is a public interest in expelling the foreigner which is based on the foreigner’s personal conduct,

2.  the foreigner has been sentenced to a term of youth custody of at least six months or a prison term of at least three months or a fine of at least 90 daily rates in the past three years due to an intentionally committed offence, or if a term of youth custody has been suspended or

Subsequent immigration to join persons granted subsidiary protection status

Section 37  
Right of return

(1) A foreigner whose lawful habitual residence as a minor was in the federal territory is to be granted a temporary residence permit if

1.  the foreigner lawfully resided in the federal territory for eight years prior to his or her departure and attended school in the federal territory for six years,

2.  the foreigner’s subsistence is ensured by his or her own economic activity or by a maintenance commitment into which a third party has entered for a period of five years and

2.  if there is a public interest in expelling the foreigner or

3.  as long as the foreigner is a minor and his or her personal care in the federal territory is not assured.

(4) The fact that the foreigner’s subsistence is no longer ensured on the basis of his or her own economic activity or that the maintenance commitment no longer applies because the five-year period has expired does not preclude extension of the temporary residence permit.

(5) A foreigner who receives a pension from an institution in the federal territory will generally be granted a temporary residence permit if the foreigner lawfully resided in the federal territory for at least eight years prior to his or her departure.

(2) In the cases covered by sections 18a, 18b, 18g (1) sentence 2 or section 18g (2), the Federal Employment Agency may grant approval to take up employment if

The competent body under section 71 may disagree with the global approval in individual cases. In this case, section 72 (7) applies accordingly.

(3) The Federal Employment Agency may give its approval to the employment of foreigners irrespective of their qualification as a skilled worker, if

1.  the foreigners are not employed under less favourable terms than German nationals employed in an equivalent position,

2.  the requirements for approval stipulated in sections 16d (3), 19, 19b, 19c (3) or section 19d (1) no. 1 or in the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners and which concern the employment are met, and

3.  no German workers, foreigners having the same legal status as German workers with regard to the right to take up employment or other foreigners who are entitled to preferential access to the labour market under the law of the European Union are available for the type of employment concerned (labour-market test), provided this test is required by the Ordinance on the Employment of Foreigners or by law.

(3a) The Federal Employment Agency may give its approval to the skilled employment of foreigners in Germany pursuant to section 20a (5) sentence 2, if the foreigners are not employed under less favourable terms than German nationals employed in an equivalent position

(4) For approval or a work permit to be granted, the employer must provide the Federal Employment Agency with information about the employment relationship, in particular the remuneration, working hours and other terms of employment, compulsory social insurance and the need for an authorisation to work in the occupation. Employers who employ or used to employ a foreigner must provide the information referred to in sentence 1 within a month of a request from the Federal Employment Agency.

(5) Subsections (1), (3) and (4) also apply if approval from the Federal Employment Agency is required for employment in case of residence for other purposes covered in Divisions 3, 5 or 7.

(6) Subsections (3) and (4) apply accordingly to work permits granted by the Federal Employment Agency. In all other cases, the legal provisions governing the approval by the Federal Employment Agency apply to the work permit in the absence of any law or statutory instrument to the contrary. The Federal Employment Agency may determine demand-oriented admission figures with regard to approving a residence title for seasonal work and for short-term employment subject to quotas and with regard to approving a seasonal work permit and a work permit for short-term employment subject to quotas.

Chapter 3  
Integration

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p1026)

Section 43  
Integration course

(1) Foreigners living lawfully in the federal territory on a permanent basis receive support in integrating into the economic, cultural and social life of the Federal Republic of Germany and are expected to undertake commensurate integration efforts in return.

(2) A basic package of measures to promote integration (integration course) supports integration efforts by foreigners. The integration course is intended to successfully teach the German language and knowledge of Germany's legal system, culture and history to foreigners. In this way, foreigners are supposed to become acquainted with the way of life in the federal territory to such an extent as to enable them to act independently in all aspects of daily life, without the assistance or mediation of third parties.

(3) The integration course comprises a basic and advanced language course of identical duration to provide sufficient command of the language and an orientation course to impart knowledge of the legal system, culture and history in Germany. The integration course is coordinated and carried out by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, which may enlist the services of private or public organisations to this end. As a general rule, reasonable fees are to be charged for attending the integration course, according due consideration to the ability to pay. The person who is obliged to ensure the foreigner’s subsistence is also obliged to pay such a charge.

(4) The Federal Government is authorised to regulate further details of the integration course, in particular the basic structure, the duration, the content and implementation of the courses, the criteria for selecting and approving course providers, the requirements and general conditions for proper and successful participation in the courses and for certifying such participation, including arrangements for the payment of costs and data processing in accordance with section 88a (1) and (1a), via a statutory instrument not requiring the approval of the Bundesrat. This excludes the examination and certification requirements of the final examinations, which are defined by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community via statutory instruments not requiring Bundesrat approval.

(5) (repealed)

Section 44  
Entitlement to attend an integration course

(1) A foreigner residing in the federal territory on a permanent basis is entitled to one-time enrolment in an integration course

1.  upon receiving a temporary residence permit for the first time

a)  for the purpose of gainful employment (sections 18a to 18d, 18g, 19c and 21),

b)  for the purpose of subsequent immigration by dependants (sections 28, 29, 30, 32, 36, 36a),

c)  on humanitarian grounds pursuant to section 25 (1), (2), (4a) sentence 3 or section 25b,

d)  as a long-term resident pursuant to section 38a or

2.  upon receiving a residence title under section 23 (2) or (4).

Permanent residence is generally assumed if the foreigner is granted a temporary residence permit valid for at least one year or has held a temporary residence permit for more than 18 months, unless the stay is of a temporary nature.

(2) The entitlement pursuant to subsection (1) expires one year after the residence title establishing the entitlement was granted or when that title expires. This does not apply if the foreigner was unable to register for an integration course within that period for reasons beyond his or her control.

(3) The entitlement to take an integration course does not apply

1.  to children, juveniles and adults who start or continue school education in the Federal Republic of Germany,

2.  when the need for integration is discernibly minimal or

3.  when the foreigner already possesses a sufficient command of the German language.

In cases covered by sentence 1 no. 3, the entitlement to take an orientation course remains unaffected.

(4) A foreigner who is not, or is no longer, entitled to take an integration course may be allowed to do so if space is available in the course concerned. This provision applies accordingly to German nationals who do not have a sufficient command of the German language and have special integration needs, as well as to foreigners

1.  who have permission to remain pending the asylum decision,

2.  whose deportation has been suspended under section 60a (2) sentence 3, or

3.  who have a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 24 or 25 (5).

Section 44a  
Obligation to attend an integration course

(1) Foreigners are required to take an integration course if

1.  they are entitled to attend under section 44 and

a)  they are unable to communicate at least at a basic level in the German language or

b)  they do not have a sufficient command of the German language at the time a residence title is issued under section 23 (2), section 28 (1) sentence 1 no. 1, section 30 or section 36a (1) sentence 1 first alternative 1 or

2.  they are receiving benefits pursuant to Book Two of the Social Code and the institution providing basic income support for jobseekers has asked them to take an integration course in accordance with section 15 (5) sentence 2 or (6) of Book Two of the Social Code,

3.  they have special integration needs and the foreigners authority requires them to participate in an integration course, or

4.  they belong to the group of persons referred to in section 44 (4) sentence 2 nos. 1 to 3, are receiving benefits under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act (_Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz_) and the competent benefit authority asks them to participate in an integration course

In cases covered by sentence 1 no. 1, the foreigners authority ascertains when issuing the residence title whether the foreigner is required to participate. In the cases covered by sentence 1 nos. 1 and 3, where foreigners are receiving benefits in accordance with Book Two of the Social Code for measures pursuant to section 15 of Book Two of the Social Code, the institution providing basic income support for jobseekers is, as a general rule, to follow the obligation imposed by the foreigners authority. Where, in individual cases, the institution providing basic income support for jobseekers decides otherwise, it is to notify the foreigners authority accordingly, which will then revoke the obligation. The obligation is to be revoked where it is unreasonable to expect a foreigner to attend a part-time course in addition to pursuing an economic activity. Further, when issuing a residence title pursuant to section 25 (1) or (2), the foreigners authorities may require a foreigner to take an integration course if he or she only has a basic command of the German language.

(1a) Unless it is withdrawn or revoked, the obligation to take an integration course pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 1 expires only if the foreigner has duly participated in the integration course.

(2) The obligation to take an integration course does not apply to foreigners

1.  who are in vocational training or any other form of training or education in the federal territory,

2.  who furnish evidence of attending comparable education measures in the federal territory or

3.  for whom attendance on a long-term basis is not feasible or reasonable.

(2a) Foreigners having a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 38a are exempt from the obligation to take an orientation course if they prove that they have already participated in integration measures in another member state of the European Union in order to attain their legal status as a long-term resident.

(3) Foreigners who fail to meet the obligation for reasons for which they are responsible or who fail to pass the final examination will be informed by the competent foreigners authority, before it extends the temporary residence permit, of the possible consequences of their actions (section 8 (3), section 9 (2) sentence 1 nos. 7 and 8, section 9a (2) sentence1 nos. 3 and 4 of this Act, section 10 (3) of the Nationality Act (_Staatsangehörigkeitsgesetz_). The foreigners authority may take administrative enforcement measures to enjoin the foreigner to meet the obligation to take an integration course. If the obligation to take an integration course is not met, the prospective charge to cover costs may also be levied in advance in a single sum by issuing an official notice of fees.

Section 45  
Integration programme

As a general rule, the integration course is to be flanked by additional integration measures organised by the Federation and the _Länder_, in particular social education and migration-specific advising services. The Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community or the body appointed by it is developing a nationwide integration programme which identifies, in particular, the existing integration measures for foreigners and ethnic German resettlers which are available from the Federation, _Länder_, local authorities and private organisations, and makes recommendations on the further development of the integration measures. The _Länder_, local authorities, the federal, _Land_ and municipal foreigners commissioners and the Federal Government Commissioner for Matters Related to Ethnic German Resettlers are involved in developing the nationwide integration programme and in compiling informational materials on existing integration measures. As a rule, religious communities, trade unions, employers’ associations, voluntary welfare organisations and other social interest groups are also to be involved.

Section 45a  
Job-related language training; authorisation to issue statutory instruments

(1) Integration in the labour market may be promoted by means of job-related German language training courses. As a rule, these courses build on the general language training provided in the integration courses. Job-related language training is coordinated and carried out by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees enlists private or public institutions to run the job-related language training courses.

(2) Foreigners are obligated to take a job-related language training course if they are receiving benefits pursuant to Book Two of the Social Code and the institution providing basic income support for jobseekers has asked them to take such a course in accordance with section 15 (5) sentence 2 or (6) of Book Two of the Social Code, Labour market integration benefits pursuant to Book Two of the Social Code and active job promotion benefits under Book Three of the Social Code remain unaffected.

(3) The Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs is authorised to regulate, by means of a statutory instrument not requiring the approval of the Bundesrat, and in agreement with the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, further details of the job-related language training, in particular the basic structure, the target groups, the duration, the content and implementation of the courses, the criteria for selecting and approving course providers, and the requirements and general conditions related to access to and proper and successful participation in the courses, including the final certificates and arrangements for the payment of costs, and the processing of data in accordance with section 88a (3).

Starting in calendar year 2026, advising, language courses, information about life in Germany and transnational assistance (pre-departure integration measures) may be offered in selected third countries. These services are intended for third-country nationals who are ordinarily resident abroad and would like to take up employment in the federal territory. The Federal Government website “Make it in Germany” will continue to be used to provide information for specific target groups on the need for skilled workers and on the immigration process in order to recruit skilled workers from third countries, and communications and support structures for recruiting skilled workers in the framework of “Make it in Germany” in Germany and abroad will be strengthened. The information, communications and support services are directed at employers in Germany and at third-country nationals already residing in the federal territory as well as those who are ordinarily resident abroad and would like to work in the federal territory.

(2) The competent authority for implementing the advisory service referred to in subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2 is the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. It may delegate the implementation of the advisory service to third parties. The competent authority for planning the pre-departure integration measures referred to in subsection (1) sentences 3 and 4 is the Office of the Federal Government Commissioner for Migration, Refugees and Integration. The task of implementing pre-departure integration measures pursuant to subsection (1) sentences 3 and 4 may be delegated to third parties. The competent authority for implementing the tasks referred to in subsection (1) sentences 5 and 5 is the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action in coordination with the participating ministries. It may delegate implementation of these tasks to third parties.

Section 48  
Obligations related to identification papers

(1) On request, foreigners are required to present and surrender

1.  their passport, passport substitute or substitute identity document and

2.  their residence title or a document confirming suspension of deportation

to the authorities entrusted with enforcing the law on foreigners and to leave such documents with these authorities temporarily, where necessary in order to implement or ensure measures under this Act. On request, German nationals who also possess a foreign nationality are required to present and surrender their passport or passport substitute to the authorities entrusted with enforcing the law on foreigners and to leave the documents with these authorities temporarily if

1.  they were denied a German passport under section 7 (1) of the Passport Act, the German passport was withdrawn under section 8 of the Passport Act or if they are subject to an order under section 6 (7) of the Act on Identity Cards (_Personalausweisgesetz_), if there are indications that they intend to leave the federal territory, or

2.  the requirements for prohibiting them from leaving the country in accordance with section 10 (1) of the Passport Act are met and presenting, handing over and temporarily leaving the foreign passport or passport substitute with the authorities is necessary to carry out or ensure the departure ban.

(2) To meet the obligation to have and present identification papers, it is sufficient for a foreigner who neither possesses a passport or passport substitute nor can reasonably be expected to obtain one to carry the certificate confirming a residence title or the suspension of deportation, if this document contains the foreigner’s personal details and a photograph and is marked to indicate that it is a substitute identity document.

(3) Foreigners who do not possess a valid passport or passport substitute are required to cooperate in efforts to obtain the identity paper and to present, hand over and leave with the authorities entrusted with enforcing this Act all such documents, other papers and data carriers as may be of importance in establishing their identity and nationality and in establishing and enforcing a possibility of removing them to another state. If the foreigner fails to meet this obligation and there is factual evidence that he or she is in possession of such documents or data carriers, the foreigner and the objects in his or her possession and his or her home may be searched to seek such documents or data carriers. Searches of homes pursuant to sentence 2 may only be ordered by a judge or, in case of imminent danger, by the authorities charged with enforcing this Act; section 58 (9a) applies accordingly. The foreigner must tolerate this measure.

(3a) The retrieval of data from data carriers, including mobile devices and cloud services, is permitted for the purpose of ensuring analysis in accordance with subsection (3b) if it is necessary to establish the foreigner’s identity and nationality and to establish and enforce the possibility of removal since the foreigner has no valid passport, passport substitute or other suitable proof of identity. The foreigner must provide the access data required for the permissible retrieval of data from of data carriers.

(3b) Analysis of the data retrieved is only permitted as far as necessary to establish the foreigner’s identity and nationality and to establish and enforce the possibility of removing him or her to another state in accordance with subsection (3) and the purpose of the measure cannot be achieved by more lenient means. Where there is factual evidence that analysing data carriers would only provide information about the core area of private life, the measure is not permissible. No information about the core area of private life which are acquired in the course of analysing data carriers may be utilised. Records thereof are to be deleted immediately. A written record is to be made of the fact of their acquisition and deletion. The data carriers may be analysed only by employees who are qualified to hold judicial office.

(3c) Retrieved data are to be deleted immediately as soon as they are no longer needed to establish the foreigner’s identity and nationality and to establish and enforce the possibility of removal. The retrieval, analysis and deletion of data is to be documented. Suitable technical and organisational measures as required by Articles 24, 25 and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are to be taken to prevent unauthorised access to the retrieved data.

(4) Where the passport requirement (section 3 (1)) is waived pursuant to section 5 (3) or section 33, a substitute identity document is issued. Subsection (3) remains unaffected.

Collection of access data

(1) If the foreigner does not provide the access data needed to analyse devices used for telecommunications purposes, the commercial providers of telecommunication services or those involved in the provision of such services may be required, where the statutory conditions for processing the data are met, to provide information about the data used to protect access to devices or to storage devices located in these devices or separate from them (section 174 (1) sentence 2 of the Telecommunications Act (_Telekommunikationsgesetz_)).

(2) The foreigner is to be informed about the request for information in advance.

(3) On the basis of a request for information pursuant to subsection (1), the commercial providers of telecommunication services or those involved in the provision of such services must immediately transmit the data necessary to provide the information.

Division 1  
Grounds establishing the obligation to leave the federal territory

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p1134)

(1) Foreigners are required to leave the federal territory if they do not or no longer possess the necessary residence title and no right of residence exists or no longer exists under the EEC/Turkey Association Agreement.

(2) Foreigners must leave the federal territory and the territory of the other member states of the European Union and the other Schengen states immediately, or, if they have been allowed a certain period for departure, before this period elapses.

(2a) (repealed)

(3) Foreigners meet the requirement to leave the federal territory by entering another member state of the European Union or another Schengen state only if they are permitted to enter and stay there. If this is the case, a foreigner who is required to leave the federal territory is to be ordered to proceed to the territory of that state without delay.

(4) A foreigner who is required to leave the federal territory and who intends to move to another address or to leave the district covered by the foreigners authority for more than three days is required to notify the foreigners authority accordingly beforehand.

(6) If a foreigner's residence is to be terminated and his or her whereabouts are unknown, the police may enter an alert in their search systems for the purpose of establishing the foreigner’s whereabouts and apprehending him or her. For the purpose of verifying a foreigner’s identity, the police may enter an alert in their search systems, if doing so is necessary to establish the foreigner's identity. If a foreigner is subject to a ban on entry and residence pursuant to section 11, an alert is to be issued in the police search systems for the purpose of refusing entry and, if the foreigner is found in the federal territory, of apprehending him or her, unless an alert for this purpose has been entered into the Schengen Information System in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 November 2018 on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of border checks, and amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, and amending and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 (OJ L 312, 7.12.2018, p. 14), or if such an alert in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 is deleted for reasons beyond the control of the Schengen state which entered the alert.

(1a) The validity of an ICT Card issued in accordance with section 19 does not expire pursuant to subsection (1) nos. 6 and 7, if the foreigner makes use of the possibility provided in Directive 2014/66/EU to carry out part of the intra-corporate transfer in another member state of the European Union. The validity of a temporary residence permit issued in accordance with section 16b or 18d does not expire pursuant to subsection (1) nos. 6 and 7, if the foreigner makes use of the possibility envisaged in Directive 2016/801/EU to carry out part of the studies or research project in another member state of the European Union.

(2) The permanent settlement permit of a foreigner who has lawfully resided in the federal territory for at least 15 years, and the permanent settlement permit of his or her cohabiting spouse do not expire pursuant to subsection (1) nos. 6 and 7 if their subsistence is secure and there is no public interest in expelling the foreigner pursuant to section 54 (1) nos. 2 to 5 or (2) nos. 5 to 7. The permanent settlement permit of a foreigner cohabiting with a German spouse does not expire pursuant to subsection (1) nos. 6 and 7 if there is no public interest in expelling the foreigner pursuant to section 54 (1) nos. 2 to 5 or (2) nos. 5 to 7. On request, the foreigners authority at the place of the foreigner’s last habitual residence issues a certificate confirming the continued validity of the permanent settlement permit.

(3) The residence title does not expire pursuant to subsection (1) no. 7 if the specified period is exceeded solely because of compulsory military service in the foreigner’s native country and the foreigner re-enters the federal territory within three months of discharge from said military service.

(4) As a rule, a longer period is granted in accordance with subsection (1) no. 7 if the foreigner intends to leave the federal territory for reasons of a temporary nature and possesses a permanent settlement permit, or if the stay outside of the federal territory serves the interests of the Federal Republic of Germany. In derogation from subsection (1) nos. 6 and 7, a foreigner’s residence title does not expire if the foreigner meets the requirements of section 37 (1) sentence 1 no. 1, if the foreigner was unlawfully forced into marriage by means of violence or threat of serious harm and was prevented from returning to Germany, and re-enters the federal territory no more than three months after the coercive situation ended and no later than 10 years after leaving the federal territory.

(5) The exemption from the requirement to have a residence title does not apply if the foreigner is expelled, removed or deported; section 11 (2) to (5) applies accordingly.

(6) Geographic and other restrictions and conditions under this Act and other acts remain in force after the residence title expires or deportation is suspended until they are lifted or the foreigner meets the obligation to leave the federal territory.

(7) If a person entitled to asylum or a foreigner whom the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees has incontestably granted refugee status leaves the federal territory, the residence title does not expire as long as the person concerned possesses a valid travel document for refugees issued by a German authority. The foreigner is not entitled to the renewed issuance of a residence title on the basis of recognition as a person entitled to asylum or by virtue of having been incontestably granted refugee status by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees if he or she has left the federal territory and the authority to issue a travel document for refugees has passed to another state.

(8) Before a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 38a (1) is suspended, before a foreigner who holds such a temporary residence permit is expelled and before a deportation order is issued pursuant to section 58a, the competent authority in the proceedings pursuant to section 91c (2) gives, through the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, the member state of the European Union in which the foreigner has the legal status of a long-term resident an opportunity to submit an opinion, if deportation to an area in which this legal status cannot be acquired is under consideration. If the opinion of the other member state is received in sufficient time, it will be taken into consideration by the competent authority.

(8a) Insofar as the authorities of other Schengen states must be notified of decisions in accordance with Article 34 of Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 taken by the foreigners authorities, notification will be via the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. The authorities charged with policing cross-border traffic will notify the authorities of other Schengen states immediately of their decisions in accordance with Article 34 of Regulation (EC) No 810/2009.

(9) The EU long-term residence permit expires only if

1.  it is revoked on account of fraudulent misrepresentation, threats or bribery,

2.  the foreigner is expelled or is issued with a deportation order under section 58a,

3.  the foreigner resides for 12 consecutive months outside of the area in which the legal status of a long-term resident can be acquired; this period is 24 consecutive months for a foreigner who previously possessed an EU Blue Card and for his or her dependants who previously possessed a temporary residence permit pursuant to sections 30, 32, 33 or 36.

4.  the foreigner remains outside of the federal territory for six years or

5.  the foreigner acquires the legal status of a long-term resident in another member state of the European Union. Subsections (2) to (4) apply accordingly to the cases referred to in sentence 1 nos. 3 and 4.

(10) In derogation from subsection (1) no. 7, the period for the EU Blue Card and the temporary residence permits pursuant to sections 30, 32, 33 or 36 issued to dependants of EU Blue Card holders is 12 months. The same applies to the permanent settlement permit of a foreigner who has resided lawfully in the federal territory for at least 15 years and to the permanent settlement permit of a spouse cohabiting with the foreigner if they are 60 years of age or older.

Section 53  
Expulsion

(1) Foreigners whose residence endangers public safety and order, the free democratic basic order or other significant interests of the Federal Republic of Germany will be expelled if, after weighing the interest in their departure against their individual interest in remaining in the federal territory, taking into account all the circumstances of the particular case, there is an overriding public interest in the foreigners’ departure.

(2) When weighing the interests referred to in subsection (1) and taking into account the circumstances of the individual case, consideration is to be given in particular to the length of the foreigner’s stay, his or her personal, economic and other ties in the federal territory and in the country of origin or in another state prepared to receive the foreigner, the consequences of expulsion for the foreigner’s dependants and civil partner, and whether the foreigner has abided by the law.

(3) Foreigners who possess a right of residence under the EEC/Turkey Association Agreement or an EU long-term residence permit may be expelled only if the personal conduct of the person concerned currently represents a serious threat to public safety and order which affects a fundamental interest of society, and expulsion is essential to protect that interest.

(3a) A foreigner who has been recognised as being entitled to asylum and who in the federal territory has the legal status of a foreign refugee within the meaning of section 3 (1) of the Asylum Act or who is entitled to subsidiary protection within the meaning of section 4 (1) of the Asylum Act or who has a travel document issued by an authority of the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951 (Federal Law Gazette 1953 II, p. 559) may only be expelled for urgent reasons of national security or public order.

(4) A foreigner who has filed an application for asylum may be expelled only on the condition that the asylum procedure has been concluded by incontestable decision without granting the foreigner recognition as a person entitled to asylum or without recognising his or her entitlement to international protection (section 1 (1) no. 2 of the Asylum Act). The condition will be waived if

1.  there are facts justifying expulsion under subsection (3a) or

2.  a deportation warning issued in accordance with the Asylum Act has become enforceable.

(2) A foreigner who is enforceably required to leave the federal territory, who will be readmitted by another member state of the European Union or Norway or Switzerland under the terms of an intergovernmental admission agreement applicable on 13 January 2009 is, as a general rule, to be removed to that state; the same applies if the foreigner is apprehended by the border authority near the border in close chronological proximity to unlawful entry into the federal territory and there are indications that another state is responsible for conducting an asylum procedure according to legislation of the European Union or an international treaty, and an admission or readmission process is initiated.

(3) Section 58 (1b), section 59 (8), section 60 (1) to (5) and (7) to (9) and sections 62 and 62a apply accordingly.

Section 58  
Deportation

(1) Foreigners are to be deported if the obligation to leave the federal territory is enforceable, no period has been allowed for departure or such a period has expired, and voluntary fulfilment of the obligation to leave is not assured or supervision of departure appears necessary on grounds of public security and order. If one of the conditions stipulated in section 59 (1) sentence 2 becomes applicable within the period allowed for departure, the foreigner is, as a rule, to be deported before the period expires.

(1a) Before deporting unaccompanied foreign minors, the authority must ensure that, in the state to which they are to be returned, they will be handed over to a family member, to a person having the right of care and custody or to an appropriate reception centre.

(1b) Foreigners holding an EU long-term residence permit or having a corresponding legal status in another member state of the European Union and who are eligible for international protection in another member state of the European Union may only be deported to the state granting protection, except in the cases covered by section 60 (8) sentence 1. The same applies to foreigners who were holders of an EU Blue Card immediately before the obligation to leave the country arose and have been granted international protection in another member state of the European Union. Section 60 (2), (3), (5) and (7) remains unaffected.

(2) The obligation to leave the federal territory is enforceable if the foreigner

1.  has entered the federal territory unlawfully,

2.  has not yet applied for the necessary residence title for the first time or for its extension or has submitted an application, but the foreigner’s residence is not deemed to be permitted pursuant to section 81 (3) or the residence title is not deemed to remain valid pursuant to section 81 (4), or

3.  is required to leave the federal territory by virtue of a return decision reached by another member state of the European Union in accordance with Article 3 of Council Directive 2001/40/EC of 28 May 2001 on the mutual recognition of decisions on the expulsion of third country nationals (OJ L 149, p. 34), if the decision concerned is recognised by the competent authority.

In all other cases, the obligation to leave the federal territory becomes enforceable only when the denial of the residence title or another administrative act requiring the foreigner to leave pursuant to section 50 (1) takes effect.

(3) Supervision of departure is necessary in particular if the foreigner

1.  is, by judicial order, in detention or another form of public custody,

2.  has failed to leave the federal territory within the period allowed for departure,

3.  has been expelled on the ground of a particularly serious public interest in expulsion as referred to in section 54 in conjunction with section 53,

4.  is destitute,

5.  does not possess a passport or passport substitute,

6.  has furnished the foreigners authority with incorrect information or refused to furnish information with intent to deceive or

7.  has indicated that he or she will not meet the obligation to leave the federal territory.

(4) The authority carrying out the deportation is authorised to take the foreigner to the airport or to a border crossing point for the purpose of deportation and to detain the foreigner temporarily for this purpose. Such detention is to be limited to the extent necessary to carry out the deportation.

(5) The authority carrying out the deportation may, to the extent necessary to carry out the deportation, enter the home of the foreigner to be deported for the purpose of apprehending the foreigner if there are facts indicating that the foreigner is present. In forms of communal accommodation, sentence 1 also applies to the home of other persons and to areas used in common by all residents. The home comprises residential and secondary premises, working and business premises, production sites and other fenced-in property.

(6) The authority carrying out the deportation may, to the extent necessary to carry out the deportation, search the home of the foreigner to be deported for the purpose of apprehending the foreigner. Searches of other persons’ homes are permitted only for the purpose of apprehending the foreigner to be deported if there are facts indicating that the foreigner is present on the premises to be searched. Subsection (5) sentence 3 applies accordingly.

(7) At night, the home may be entered or searched only if there are facts indicating that it would otherwise be impossible to apprehend the foreigner for the purpose of deportation. Organising the deportation does not constitute a fact as referred to in sentence 1 unless it involves conditions which cannot be influenced by the authority carrying out the deportation.

(8) Searches under subsection (6) may only be ordered by a judge or, in case of danger in delay, by the authority carrying out the deportation. After entering the home in accordance with subsection (5), the fact that the foreigner was not found there cannot be used to justify the assumption of danger in delay.

(9) The occupant of the premises to be searched may be present during the search. If the occupant is absent, the occupant’s representative or adult family member, another member of the household or a neighbour is to be present, if possible. In the cases of subsection (6) sentence 2, the occupant or representative in the occupant’s absence is to be informed in advance of the purpose of the search. A record of the search is to be made. This record must include the responsible police station, the reason for the search, the time and place of the search and, if no court order was issued, the facts justifying the assumption of danger in delay. The home’s occupant or the occupant’s representative is to be given a copy of the record upon request. If, under the special circumstances of the case, it is impossible to make a record or to provide a copy of the record, or if doing so would jeopardise the purpose of the search, the home’s occupant or the occupant’s representative is to be given written confirmation of the search including the responsible police station and the time and place of the search.

(9a) The ordinary courts of law are responsible for judicial orders pursuant to subsection (8). The provisions of the Act on Proceedings in Family Matters and in Matters of Non-Contentious Jurisdiction apply to the procedure accordingly. The _Länder_ may, in derogation from sentences 1 and 2, may determine that the administrative courts have jurisdiction.

(10) More detailed provisions of the _Länder_ concerning the content of subsections (5) to (9) remain unaffected. This applies accordingly to federal and _Länder_ provisions concerning the regulatory content of subsection (4).

Section 58a  
Deportation order

(1) The supreme _Land_ authority may issue a deportation order for a foreigner without a prior expulsion order based on the assessment of facts, in order to avert a special threat to the security of the Federal Republic of Germany or a terrorist threat. The deportation order is immediately enforceable; no deportation warning is necessary.

(2) The Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community may assume responsibility if a special interest on the part of the Federation applies. The supreme _Land_ authority is to be notified accordingly. Deportation orders issued by the Federation are enforced by the Federal Police.

(3) A deportation order may not be enforced if the conditions for a deportation ban pursuant to section 60 (1) to (8) are met. Section 59 (2) and (3) applies accordingly. Assessment in this context is carried out by the authority deciding on the deportation order; this authority is not bound by findings reached in this connection in other proceedings.

(4) After the deportation order has been announced, foreigners are to be given an opportunity to contact a legal adviser of their choice without delay, unless they have secured the services of a lawyer beforehand; foreigners are to be informed of this entitlement, of the legal consequences of the deportation order and the available legal remedies. An application for temporary relief pursuant to the Code of Administrative Court Procedure (_Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung_) must be filed within seven days of announcement of the deportation order. Deportation may not be enforced until the period referred to in sentence 2 has expired and, if an application for temporary relief is filed in time, until the court has decided on said application.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p1350)

Section 59  
Deportation warning

(1) The foreigner is to be served with a deportation warning specifying a reasonable period of between seven and 30 days for voluntary departure, provided no deportation ban applies and deportation would not be contrary to the well-being of a child, to family ties or to the foreigner’s health. By way of exception, a shorter period may be set or such a period may be waived altogether if, in individual cases, it is vital to safeguard overriding public interests, in particular where

1.  a well-founded suspicion exists that the foreigner intends to evade deportation,

2.  the foreigner poses a serious threat to public safety or law and order.

Under the conditions in sentence 2, warning the foreigner of intention to deport may also be waived if

1.  the residence title pursuant to section 51 (1) nos. 3 to 5 has expired or

2.  the foreigner has already been informed in accordance with the requirements of section 77 that he or she is required to leave the federal territory.

Taking account of the particular circumstances of each case, the period allowed for departure may be extended as appropriate or a longer period may be set. Section 60a (2) remains unaffected. If the obligation to leave or the deportation warning ceases to be enforceable, the period allowed for departure is to be interrupted and begins to run again when the obligation or notice becomes enforceable once more. It is not necessary to set a new time limit. When the period allowed for voluntary departure expires, the foreigner is not to be informed of the date of the deportation.

(2) As a rule, the deportation warning is to specify the state to which the foreigner is to be deported and is to inform the foreigner that he or she may also be deported to another state which he or she is permitted to enter or which is obliged to admit him or her. Entities and territorial authorities as referred to in Annexes I and II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1806 have the same status as states.

(3) Deportation bans and the grounds listed in subsection (1) sentence 1 for the temporary suspension of deportation are no obstacle to issuing a deportation warning if the foreigner is required to leave the country because of or following a criminal conviction or is the subject of a pending extradition procedure. The state to which the foreigner may not be deported is to be specified in the deportation warning. If the administrative court establishes the existence of a deportation ban, the lawfulness of the deportation warning otherwise remains unaffected.

(4) Once the deportation warning is no longer subject to appeal, the foreigners authority is not to take into account in further decisions any circumstances constituting an obstacle to deportation to the state specified in the deportation warning and which occurred before the deportation warning was no longer subject to appeal; any other circumstances cited by the foreigner constituting an obstacle to deportation, or to deportation to the specified state, may be ignored. The provisions enabling the foreigner to assert the validity of the circumstances referred to in sentence 1 through a court of law by means of a legal action or the temporary relief procedure pursuant to the Code of Administrative Court Procedure remain unaffected.

(5) It is not necessary to set a deadline in cases covered by section 58 (3) no. 1; the foreigner will be deported directly from detention or public custody.

(6) The foreigner is to be issued a certificate confirming that a period for departure has been set pursuant to subsection (1).

(7) If the foreigners authority has concrete grounds to suspect that the foreigner was the victim of a criminal offence as referred to in section 25 (4a) sentence 1 or section 25 (4b) sentence 1, in derogation from subsection (1) sentence 1, the foreigners authority sets a period for departure which will allow the foreigner sufficient time to decide whether he or she is prepared to testify in accordance with section 25 (4a) sentence 2 no. 3 or section 25 (4b) sentence 2 no. 2. A period of at least three months will be allowed for departure. The foreigners authority may refrain from setting a period for departure pursuant to sentence 1 or may annul or reduce the period for departure, if

1.  the foreigner’s stay is detrimental to public safety and order or other substantial interests of the Federal Republic of Germany or

2.  the foreigner has voluntarily re-established contact with the persons referred to in section 25 (4a) sentence 2 no. 2 after being duly informed pursuant to sentence 4.

The foreigners authority or a body authorised by it informs the foreigner of the applicable arrangements, programmes and measures for victims of criminal offences referred to in section 25 (4a) sentence 1.

(8) Before being deported, foreigners who were employed without the entitlement to pursue an economic activity required under section 4a (5) are to be informed of their rights pursuant to Article 6 (2) and Article 13 of Directive 2009/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 providing for minimum standards on sanctions and measures against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals (OJ L 168, 30.6.2009, p. 24).

Section 60  
Deportation bans

(1) In application of the Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees (Federal Law Gazette 1953 II, p. 559), foreigners may not be deported to a state in which their life or liberty is threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a certain social group or political convictions. This also applies to persons who are entitled to asylum and to foreigners who have been incontestably granted refugee status or who have the legal status of foreign refugees on other grounds in the federal territory or who have been granted foreign refugee status outside of the federal territory in accordance with the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. If a foreigner invokes the ban on deportation pursuant to this subsection, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees is to establish in an asylum procedure whether the conditions stated in sentence 1 apply, and the foreigner is to be granted refugee status, except in cases covered by sentence 2. The decision by the Federal Office may only be contestable subject to the provisions of the Asylum Act.

(2) Foreigners may not be deported to a state where they face serious harm as referred to in section 4 (1) of the Asylum Act. Subsection (1) sentences 3 and 4 applies accordingly.

(3) If a foreigner may not be deported to a state in which he or she is wanted for a criminal offence and there is a danger that the death penalty will be imposed or enforced, the provisions on extradition apply accordingly.

(4) If a formal request for extradition or a request for arrest combined with a notification of intent to file a request for extradition has been received from another state, the foreigner may be deported to this state prior to the decision on extradition only with the approval of the authority responsible for approving extradition under section 74 of the Act on International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (_Gesetz über die internationale Rechtshilfe in Strafsachen_).

(5) A foreigner may not be deported if deportation is prohibited under the terms of the Convention of 4 November 1950 for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Federal Law Gazette 1952 II, p. 685).

(6) The general risk that a foreigner may face prosecution and punishment in another state and, unless otherwise stipulated in subsections (2) to (5), the concrete threat of lawful punishment under the legal system of another state does not preclude deportation.

(7) As a rule, foreigners are not to be deported to another state in which they face a substantial concrete threat to life and limb or liberty. Section 60a (2c) sentences 2 and 3 applies accordingly. A substantial concrete threat for health reasons only exists in the case of life-threatening or serious illness which would significantly worsen if the foreigner is deported. It is not necessary for medical care in the state of destination to be equivalent to medical care in the Federal Republic of Germany. Sufficient medical care generally also exists where it is guaranteed only in part of the state of destination. Threats as referred to in sentence 1 to which the population or the segment of the population to which the foreigner belongs are generally exposed are to be taken into account in orders pursuant to section 60a (1) sentence 1.

(8) Subsection (1) does not apply if, for serious reasons, the foreigner is to be regarded as a threat to the security of the Federal Republic of Germany or constitutes a threat to the general public because he or she has been incontestably sentenced to a prison term of at least three years for a crime or a particularly serious offence. The same applies if the foreigner meets the conditions stipulated in section 3 (2) of the Asylum Act. Application of subsection (1) may be waived if the foreigner represents a threat to the general public because he or she has been incontestably sentenced to a prison term or a term of youth custody of at least one year for one or more intentionally committed offences against life, physical integrity, sexual self-determination or property or for resisting enforcement officers if the criminal offence was committed using violence, using a threat of harm to life or limb, or with guile, or if it constitutes an offence pursuant to section 177 of the Criminal Code.

(9) In the cases covered by subsection (8), a foreigner who has filed an application for asylum may, in derogation from the provisions of the Asylum Act, be notified of intention to deport and duly deported. Subsections (2) to (7) remain unaffected.

(10) If a foreigner to whom the conditions in subsection (1) apply is to be deported, a deportation warning must be sent and a reasonable period must be allowed for departure. Those states to which the foreigner may not be deported are to be specified in the deportation warning.

(11) (repealed)

Section 60a  
Temporary suspension of deportation (_Duldung_)

(1) For reasons of international law or on humanitarian grounds or to safeguard the political interests of the Federal Republic of Germany, the supreme _Land_ authority may order the deportation of foreigners from specific states or of categories of foreigners defined by any other means to be suspended in general or with regard to deportation to specific states for a maximum of three months. Section 23 (1) applies to a period in excess of six months.

(2) The deportation of a foreigner is to be suspended for as long as deportation is impossible in fact or in law and no temporary residence permit is granted. The deportation of a foreigner is also to be suspended if the public prosecutor’s office or the criminal court considers his or her temporary presence in the federal territory to be appropriate in connection with criminal proceedings relating to a criminal offence, because it would be more difficult to investigate the facts of the case without information from the foreigner. Foreigners may be granted a temporary suspension of deportation if their continued presence in the federal territory is necessary on urgent humanitarian or personal grounds or due to substantial public interests. Where the recording of the acknowledgement of paternity or the mother’s consent to carry out a procedure pursuant to section 85a is suspended, the deportation of the foreigner acknowledging paternity, of the foreign mother or the foreign child is to be suspended until the procedure pursuant to section 85a has been concluded by means of an enforceable decision.

(2a) The deportation of a foreigner is to be suspended for one week where his or her removal or deportation has failed, custody awaiting deportation is not ordered and the Federal Republic of Germany is obliged to readmit the foreigner by virtue of a legal provision, in particular Article 6 (1) of Council Directive 2003/110/EC of 25 November 2003 on assistance in cases of transit for the purposes of removal by air (OJ L 321, 6.12.2003, p. 26). Suspension pursuant to sentence 1 may not be extended. The foreigner is to be allowed to enter the federal territory.

(2b) For as long as a foreigner who holds a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 25a (1) is a minor, the deportation of his or her parents or of one parent having the sole right of care and custody as well as of those minor children who live as a family unit with the parents or the parent having the sole right of care and custody is, as a rule, to be suspended.

(2c) It is assumed that the deportation is not precluded on health grounds. The foreigner must provide credible evidence of an illness which might interfere with deportation by submitting a qualified medical certificate. As a rule, this medical certificate is to document in particular the factual circumstances on which the professional assessment was based, the method of establishing the facts, the specialist medical assessment of the illness (diagnosis), the severity of the illness, its Latin name or classification according to ICD 10 and the medical assessment of the probable consequences of the situation resulting from the illness. Medications needed to treat the illness must be listed along with their active ingredients under the names used in international practice.

(2d) The foreigner is required to submit the medical certificate referred to in subsection (2c) immediately to the competent authority. If the foreigner fails to submit such a medical certificate immediately, the competent authority need not take into account the foreigner’s submissions regarding his or her illness, unless the foreigner was prevented, through no fault of his or her own, from obtaining such a certificate or there is other factual evidence for the existence of a life-threatening or serious illness which would be significantly worsened by deportation. If the foreigner submits a certificate and the authority then orders a medical examination, the authority is entitled not to take the reported illness into account if the foreigner does not comply with the order without sufficient reason. The foreigner is to be informed of the obligations and the legal consequences of any breach of these obligations pursuant to this subsection.

(3) Suspension of deportation does not affect the foreigner’s obligation to leave the federal territory.

(4) The foreigner is to be issued with a certificate confirming the suspension of deportation.

(5) The suspension of deportation lapses when the foreigner leaves the federal territory. The suspension is revoked when the circumstances preventing deportation cease to apply. The foreigner is deported without delay when the suspension lapses, without any renewed deportation warning specifying a deadline, unless the suspension is renewed.

(5a) If the deportation of a foreigner who has children under age 12 is suspended for more than a year, the foreigner is to be notified of the planned deportation at least one month in advance when the suspension is revoked as referred to in subsection (5) sentence 2; the notification is to be repeated if the suspension has been renewed for more than a year. Sentence 1 does not apply if the foreigner brought about the obstacle to deportation by intentionally furnishing false information or by own deceit concerning his or her identity or nationality or if he or she fails to meet reasonable requirements to cooperate in removing obstacles to departure.

(5b) As a general rule, foreigners whose deportation has been suspended are to be permitted to engage in economic activity if the Federal Employment Agency has granted its approval or a statutory instrument stipulates that the employment concerned is permitted without the approval of the Federal Employment Agency. Sentence 1 does not apply if at the time of application for permission to pursue an economic activity concrete measures to terminate residence are imminent which are close enough to the termination of residence in terms of content and timing; such concrete measures to terminate residence are imminent if

1.  a medical examination to determine the ability to travel has been carried out,

2.  the foreigner has applied for government funds to assist with voluntary departure,

3.  the process of booking transport for the deportation has been initiated,

4.  similar concrete preparations to deport the foreigner have been initiated, unless it is foreseeable from the outset that such measures will be unsuccessful, or

5.  the procedure for determining the member state responsible in accordance with Article 20 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 has been initiated.

(6) In all other cases, foreigners whose deportation has been suspended may not be permitted to pursue an economic activity if

1.  they entered the country to obtain benefits under the Act on Benefits for Asylum Applicants,

2.  measures to terminate their stay cannot be carried out for reasons for which they are responsible, or

3.  they are nationals of a safe country of origin according to section 29a of the Asylum Act and an asylum application which they filed after 31 August 2015 has been denied or withdrawn, unless the application was withdrawn based on advising from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees as referred to in section 24 (1) of the Asylum Act, or no asylum application was filed.

Foreigners are in particular responsible for reasons referred to in sentence 1 no. 2 if they themselves have brought about the obstacle to deportation by their own deceit concerning their identity or nationality or by furnishing false information. Sentence 1 no. 3 does not apply to unaccompanied foreign minors whose asylum applications have been withdrawn or for whom no application for asylum was made if the application was withdrawn or no application was made in the best interests of the child. In derogation from sentences 1 to 3, foreigners who have been recognised as being entitled to asylum and who in the federal territory have the legal status of a foreign refugee or are entitled to subsidiary protection are permitted to pursue an economic activity.

Section 60b  
Temporary suspension of deportation for persons whose identity is not verified

(1) A temporary suspension of deportation as referred to in section 60a is granted as a temporary suspension of deportation for persons whose identity is not verified to foreigners who are enforceably required to leave the federal territory, if they cannot be deported for reasons for which they themselves are responsible, because they brought about the obstacle to deportation by deceit concerning their identity or nationality or by furnishing false information or by failing to undertake reasonable efforts to acquire a passport or passport substitute as required by subsection (2) sentence 1 and subsection (3) sentence 1. Such foreigners are to be issued with a certificate confirming the suspension of deportation under section 60a (4) with the additional wording “for persons whose identity is not verified”.

(2) If foreigners who are enforceably required to leave the federal territory have no valid passport or passport substitute, they are required without prejudice to section 3 to undertake all efforts reasonable in view of the circumstances of the individual case to acquire a passport or passport substitute. This does not apply to foreigners from the time they have filed an application for asylum (section 13 of the Asylum Act) or made a request for asylum (section 18 of the Asylum Act) until the asylum application has been rejected with final and binding effect, or to foreigners to whom a deportation ban under section 60 (5) or (7) applies, unless the deportation ban under section 60 (7) is based solely on health reasons.

(3) As referred to in subsection (2) sentence 1, as a rule it is reasonable to expect the foreigner to

1.  cooperate in the issuing or extension of the passport or passport substitute in compliance with the provisions of German passport law, in particular sections 6 and 15 of the Passport Act (_Passgesetz_) in the applicable version, and accept the processing of an application by the authorities of the foreigner's country of origin according to the law of the country of origin, as long as this does not result in unreasonable hardship;

2.  appear in person at the authorities of the country of origin, participate in interviews, provide photos as requested and provide fingerprints, information or explanations as required by the legal and administrative practice of the country of origin, and take all other actions required by the legal and administrative practice there, as long as these are not unreasonable;

3.  provide a statement to the authorities of the country of origin declaring that the foreigner will voluntarily leave the federal territory as required by German law, if issuing the travel document depends on making such a statement;

4.  declare the intention to complete compulsory military service, if issuing the travel document depends on such a statement, as long as completing compulsory military service is not unreasonable for compelling reasons, and to fulfil other reasonable civic duties;

5.  pay the regular fees set by the country of origin for issuing official passports and passport substitutes, as long as the foreigner can reasonably be expected to do so; and

6.  re-apply for a passport or passport substitute as far as reasonable and undertake the efforts referred to in nos. 1 to 5 again if there is a good chance that the authorities of the country of origin will issue the passport or passport substitute due to a change in the law or circumstances and if the foreigners authority requires the foreigner to undertake these efforts again.

The foreigner is to be informed of these obligations. They will be regarded as met when the foreigner presents plausible evidence that he or she has undertaken the efforts referred to in sentence 1. If the foreigners authority informs the foreigner that the statements and evidence to substantiate that he or she has undertaken one or more efforts referred to in sentence 1 do not suffice, the foreigners authority may set a deadline for the foreigner to solemnly declare in lieu of an oath that he or she has undertaken the efforts referred to in sentence 1. The foreigners authority is the competent authority as referred to in section 156 of the Criminal Code.

(4) If the foreigner has not undertaken the reasonable efforts referred to in subsection (2) sentence 1 and subsection (3) sentence 1, he or she may undertake them at any later time. In this case, the obligation to cooperate will be regarded as met and the foreigner will be issued with a certificate confirming the suspension of deportation under section 60a (4) without the additional wording “for persons whose identity is not verified”. Subsection (5) sentence 1 remains unaffected.

(5) The length of time during which the certificate contained the additional wording “for persons whose identity is not verified” will not be counted towards the future suspension of deportation for persons in vocational training or employment (_Vorduldungszeiten_). Foreigners holding certificates containing the additional wording “for persons whose identity is not verified” are not allowed to pursue an economic activity. They are subject to a residence restriction as referred to in section 61 (1d).

(6) Section 84 (1) sentence 1 no. 3 and (2) sentences 1 and 3 applies accordingly.

Section 60c  
Temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of training (Ausbildungsduldung)

(1) Temporary suspension of deportation as referred to in section 60a (2) sentence 3 is to be granted if the foreigner in Germany

1.  is an asylum applicant who

a)  has started quality vocational training in a state-recognised or similarly regulated occupation, or

b)  has started training as an assistant or helper in a state-recognised or similarly regulated occupation which may lead to quality vocational training in a state-recognised or similarly regulated occupation in which the Federal Employment Agency has determined that a labour shortage exists, and has been granted a training place,

and would like to continue this training after the application for asylum has been denied, or

2.  has been granted a temporary suspension of deportation under section 60a and starts training as referred to in no. 1.

In cases of obvious fraud, temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of training may be denied. In the case of sentence 1, an employment permit is to be granted.

(2) Temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of training is not granted if

1.  any of the conditions listed in section 60a (6) apply,

2.  in the case of subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 2, the foreigner has not yet possessed a temporary suspension of deportation for three months at the time of applying,

3.  the foreigner’s identity was not verified

a)  before applying for a temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of training, if the foreigner entered the federal territory by 31 December 2016; or,

b)  before applying for a temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of training, but no later than 30 June 2020, if the foreigner entered the federal territory after 1 January 2017 and before 1 January 2020; or

c)  during the first six months after entry, if the foreigner entered the federal territory after 31 December 2019;

the foreigner will be deemed to have met the deadline if he or she took all necessary and reasonable measures to verify his or her identity within the time periods given in (a) to (c), but his or her identity was unable to be verified until after these periods for reasons beyond the foreigner’s control,

4.  any of the conditions listed in section 19d (1) no. 6 or 7 applies, or the foreigner is subject to an expulsion order or a deportation order pursuant to section 58a, or

5.  in the case of subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 2, at the time of application concrete measures to terminate residence are imminent which are close enough to the termination of residence in terms of content and timing; such concrete measures to terminate residence are imminent if

a)  a medical examination to determine the ability to travel has been carried out,

b)  the foreigner has applied for government funds to assist with voluntary departure,

c)  the process of booking transport for the deportation has been initiated,

d)  similar concrete preparations to deport the foreigner have been initiated, unless it is foreseeable from the outset that such measures will be unsuccessful, or

e)  the process for determining the member state responsible in accordance with Article 20 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 has been initiated.

(3) An application for temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of vocational training may be made no earlier than seven months before the vocational training begins. A temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of vocational training as referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 2 will be granted no earlier than six months before the vocational training begins. It will be granted if, at the time the temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of training was applied for, the training contract had already been entered in the list of vocational training relationships at the responsible body, or such entry had been applied for, or, if such entry is not necessary, the training contract was concluded with the educational institution or a state or state-recognised educational institution has approved the training contract. The temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of training is granted for the duration of vocational training as specified in the training contract.

(4) The temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of training expires if any of the conditions listed in subsection (2) no. 4 occurs or if the training ends earlier than planned or is discontinued.

(5) If the training ends earlier than planned or is discontinued, the educational institution is required to notify the competent foreigners authority immediately, generally within two weeks, in written or electronic form. The notification is to include the facts to be notified and when they arose, as well as the foreigner’s surnames, given names and nationality.

(6) If the training relationship ends earlier than planned or is discontinued, the foreigner is to be granted a one-time suspension of deportation for six months for the purpose of seeking another training place in order to begin vocational training in accordance with subsection (1). Suspension of deportation is granted for six months for the purpose of seeking employment commensurate with the acquired vocational qualification if, after successfully completing the vocational training for which the suspension of deportation was granted, the foreigner is not kept on in the training enterprise; the suspension of deportation granted to enable the foreigner to seek employment may not be extended for this purpose.

(7) Temporary suspension of deportation as referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1 may be granted without regard to subsection (2) no. 3 if the foreigner has taken the necessary and reasonable measures to verify his or her identity.

(8) In all other cases, section 60a remains unaffected.

Section 60d  
Temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of employment (_Beschäftigungsduldung_)

(1) As a general rule, the deportation of foreigners required to leave the federal territory and their spouses or civil partners who entered the federal territory before 31 December 2022 is to be temporarily suspended under section 60a (2) sentence 3 for 30 months if

1.  their identities have been verified

a)  before applying for temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of employment and the foreigner entered the federal territory by 31 December 2016, or

b)  the foreigner entered the federal territory between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2022 until 31 December 2024, or in the cases in which the application is submitted before the end of 31 December 2024, before applying for temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of employment;

c)  the deadline will be deemed to have been met if the foreigner and his or her spouse or civil partner took all necessary and reasonable measures to verify their identity within the time periods given in (a) and (b), but their identity was unable to be verified until after these periods for reasons beyond their control,

2.  the foreigner required to leave the federal territory has possessed a temporary suspension of deportation for at least 12 months,

3.  the foreigner required to leave the federal territory has been in employment with full social security coverage and regular working hours of at least 20 hours per week,

4.  the employment of the foreigner required to leave the federal territory has ensured his or her subsistence for the past 12 months before he or she applied for temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of employment,

5.  the employment of the foreigner required to leave the federal territory ensures his or her subsistence,

6.  the foreigner has an elementary oral command of the German language,

7.  the foreigner required to leave the federal territory and his or her spouse or civil partner have not been convicted of an offence intentionally committed in the federal territory; convictions as referred to in section 32 (2) no. 5 (a) of the Act on the Central Criminal Register (_Bundeszentralregistergesetz_) for offences which, under the Residence Act or the Asylum Act, can only be committed by foreigners are to be ignored as a general principle,

8.  the foreigner required to leave the federal territory and his or her spouse or civil partner have no links to extremist or terrorist organisations and do not support such organisations,

9.  the foreigner is not subject to an expulsion order or deportation order pursuant to section 58a,

10.  the school attendance of minor, unmarried school-aged children living with the foreigner as a family unit has been verified, none of the cases listed in section 54 (2) nos. 1 to 2 applies and the children have not been incontestably convicted of intentionally committing an offence listed in section 29 (1) sentence 1 no. 1 of the Narcotics Act, and

11.  the foreigner required to leave the federal territory and his or her spouse or civil partner, if required to take an integration course, have successfully completed the integration course or discontinued it for reasons beyond their control.

(2) The minor, unmarried children living with the foreigner as a family unit are to be granted a temporary suspension of deportation for the same length of time.

(3) The temporary suspension of deportation granted pursuant to subsection (1) is to be revoked if any of the conditions listed in subsection (1) nos. 1 to 10 is no longer met. In the case of subsection (1) nos. 3 and 4, brief interruptions beyond the foreigner’s control are not taken into account. If the employment relationship is terminated, the employer is required to inform the responsible foreigners authority, within two weeks of becoming aware of the termination, in written or electronic form of the date of termination, the surname, first name and nationality of the foreigner.

Section 82 (6) applies accordingly.

(4) Temporary suspension of deportation as referred to in subsection (1) may be granted without regard to subsection

(1) no. 1 if the foreigner has taken the necessary and reasonable measures to verify his or her identity.

(5) In all other cases, section 60a remains unaffected.

Section 61  
Geographic restrictions, residence restriction, departure facilities

(1) The stay of a foreigner who is enforceably required to leave the federal territory is restricted in geographic terms to the territory of the _Land_ concerned. The geographic restriction referred to in sentence 1 may be waived if the foreigner is entitled to take up employment without a labour-market test pursuant to section 39 (2) sentence 1 no. 1 or if necessary to attend school, to participate in basic and advanced vocational training or to study at a state or state-recognised university or a comparable educational institution. The same applies if this serves to preserve the family unit.

(1a) In cases covered by section 60a (2a), residence is restricted to the administrative district of the most recently responsible foreigners authority. The foreigner must proceed to such location without delay after entering the federal territory. If it is impossible to determine which foreigners authority is responsible, section 15a applies accordingly.

(1b) A geographic restriction in accordance with subsections (1) and (1a) expires if the foreigner has resided in the federal territory for three months without interruption either with a temporary residence permit or permanent settlement permit, with a temporary suspension of deportation or with permission to remain pending the asylum decision.

(1c) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (1b), a geographic restriction for the stay of a foreigner who is enforceably required to leave the federal territory may be ordered if

1.  the foreigner has been incontestably convicted of a criminal offence, with the exception of those offences which can only be committed by foreigners,

2.  facts justify the conclusion that the foreigner has violated the provisions of the Narcotics Act or

3.  concrete measures to terminate the foreigner’s stay are imminent.

As a general rule, a geographic restriction to the district of the foreigners authority is to be ordered if the foreigner brought about the obstacle to deportation by intentionally furnishing false information or by own deceit concerning his or her identity or nationality, or if he or she fails to meet reasonable requirements to cooperate in removing obstacles to departure.

(1d) A foreigner who is enforceably required to leave the federal territory and whose subsistence is not ensured is required to take up habitual residence at a specific place (residence restriction). Unless the foreigners authority has ordered otherwise, this is the place where the foreigner was residing when the decision to temporarily suspend deportation was taken. The foreigners authority may amend the residence restriction ex officio or at the foreigner's request; the household community of family members or other humanitarian grounds of comparable importance are to be taken into account. The foreigner may temporarily leave the place determined in the residence restriction without permission.

(1e) Conditions may be imposed to secure and enforce the enforceable obligation to leave the country if concrete measures to terminate residence are imminent. In particular, foreigners may be required to report to the foreigners authority responsible for their place of residence once a week or less often.

(1f) Further conditions and requirements may be imposed.

(2) The _Länder_ may establish departure facilities for foreigners who are enforceably required to leave the federal territory. As a general rule, support and counselling are to be provided at such departure facilities to promote foreigners’ willingness to leave the federal territory voluntarily, and access for authorities and courts and implementation of the departure procedure is to be ensured.

Section 62  
Custody awaiting deportation

(1) Custody awaiting deportation is not permitted if the purpose of the custody can be achieved by other, less severe means. Custody is to be limited to the shortest possible duration. Minors and families with minor children are not to be taken into custody awaiting deportation.

(2) Foreigners are to be taken into custody by judicial order to enable the preparation of expulsion or a deportation order pursuant to section 58a, if a decision on expulsion or the deportation order pursuant to section 58a cannot be reached immediately and deportation would be much more difficult or impossible without such detention (custody to prepare deportation). As a rule, the duration of custody to prepare deportation is not to exceed six weeks. In case of expulsion, no new judicial order is required to continue custody until the ordered term of custody expires.

(3) Foreigners are to be taken into custody by judicial order for the purpose of safeguarding deportation (custody to secure deportation) if

1.  there is a risk of absconding,

2.  the foreigner is enforceably required to leave the federal territory on account of having entered the territory unlawfully or has become enforceably required to leave the federal territory after having entered the territory lawfully,

3.  a deportation order has been issued pursuant to section 58a but is not immediately enforceable, or

4.  the foreigner entered and is residing in the federal territory in violation of an entry and residence ban.

By way of exception, the order for custody to secure deportation pursuant to sentence 1 no. 2 may be waived for foreigners who credibly assert that they do not intend to evade deportation. Custody to secure deportation is not permitted if it is established that it will not be possible to carry out deportation within the next six months for reasons beyond the foreigner’s control. In derogation from sentence 3, foreigners posing a significant threat to the life and limb of others or to significant legally protected internal security interests may be taken into custody to secure deportation even if they cannot be deported within the next six months.

(3a) Risk of absconding as referred to in subsection (3) sentence 1 no. 1 is assumed unless proven otherwise if

1.  the foreigner has deceived the authorities responsible for enforcing this law regarding his or her identity or in a way relevant for an obstacle precluding deportation and around the same time as the deportation, in particular by suppressing or destroying identity or travel documents or claiming a false identity, and has not corrected the information him- or herself,

2.  without being excused, the foreigner fails to appear for an interview or a medical examination pursuant to section 82 (4) sentence 1 at the place specified by the foreigners authority, if the foreigner was informed when notified of the appointment that he or she could be taken into custody for failure to appear,

3.  the period allowed for departure has expired and the foreigner has changed his or her place of residence without notifying the foreigners authority of an address where he or she can be reached,

4.  (repealed)

5.  the foreigner has evaded deportation in the past, or

6.  the foreigner has expressly declared that he or she intends to evade deportation.

(3b) The following may constitute concrete evidence of a risk of absconding within the meaning of subsection (3) sentence 1 no. 1:

1.  the foreigner has deceived the authorities responsible for enforcing this law regarding his or her identity in a way relevant for an obstacle precluding deportation, in particular by suppressing or destroying identity or travel documents or claiming a false identity, and has not corrected the information him- or herself,

2.  foreigner has paid considerable sums of money, in particular to third parties, for activities referred to in section 96, and these sums are so considerable given the circumstances that it can be concluded that the foreigner will prevent deportation to ensure that the expense was not in vain,

3.  the foreigner constitutes a significant threat to the life and limb of others or to significant legally protected internal security interests,

4.  the foreigner has repeatedly been incontestably sentenced to at least one prison term for intentionally committed criminal offences,

5.  the foreigner has failed to meet the obligation specified in section 60b (3) sentence 1 nos. 1, 2 and 6 to acquire a passport or passport substitute or has refused or failed to cooperate as required by law in ways other than those listed in subsection (3a) no. 2, in particular the obligation to cooperate pursuant to section 48 (3) sentence 1 and was informed in advance of the possibility of being taken into custody for failing to meet the obligation to acquire a passport or passport substitute as required by section 60b (3) sentence 1 nos. 1, 2 and 6 or for refusing or failing to cooperate,

6.  after the period allowed for departure has expired, the foreigner has repeatedly violated an obligation specified in section 61 (1) sentence 1, subsection (1a), (1c) sentence 1 no. 3 or sentence 2, or has failed to comply with an obligation to secure and enforce the obligation to leave the country pursuant to section 61 (1e),

(4) Custody to secure deportation may be ordered for up to six months. It may be extended by a maximum of 12 months in cases in which the foreigner hinders his or her deportation. It may also be extended by a maximum of 12 months where custody has been ordered on the basis of subsection (3) sentence 1 no. 3, and where the transmission of the necessary documents by the third country obligated or willing to admit the foreigner is delayed. Custody to secure deportation may not last longer than 18 months. A period of custody to prepare deportation counts towards the overall length of custody to secure deportation.

(4a) Where deportation has failed, the order remains unaffected until the period allowed for deportation has expired, insofar as the conditions for the detention order remain unchanged.

(5) The authority responsible for applying for detention may detain a foreigner without a prior judicial order and place such foreigner in temporary custody if

1.  there is a strong suspicion that the conditions pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 1 apply,

2.  it is not possible to obtain the court ruling on the order for custody to secure deportation beforehand and

3.  there is a well-founded suspicion that the foreigner intends to evade the order for custody to secure deportation.

The foreigner is to be brought before the court without delay for a decision on the order for custody to secure deportation.

(6) For the purpose of deportation, foreigners may be taken into custody by judicial order for a maximum of 14 days in order to enforce an order pursuant to section 82 (4) sentence 1 to appear in person at the diplomatic representations or before authorised officials of the state whose nationality they putatively possess to provide information needed to establish their identity, or to enable a medical examination to determine their fitness to travel if

1.  the foreigner

a)  failed to appear in person following the first such order without being excused or has not provided the information needed to establish his or her identity, or

b)  without being excused, failed to appear in person for an appointment at the competent authority following an order pursuant to section 82 (4) sentence 1 or, during the appointment, did not provide the information needed to establish his or her identity and

2.  was informed in advance of the possibility of being taken into custody (custody to enforce cooperation).

It is not possible to extend the length of custody to enforce cooperation. A period of custody to enforce cooperation counts towards the overall duration of custody to secure deportation. Section 62a (1) applies accordingly.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p1516)

Section 62a  
Enforcement of custody awaiting deportation

(1) Custody awaiting deportation is enforced in specialised detention facilities. If no specialised detention facilities are available in the federal territory, or if the foreigner constitutes a significant threat to the life and limb of others or to significant legally protected internal security interests, custody awaiting deportation may be enforced in other penal institutions; in this case, detainees awaiting deportation are to be accommodated separately from prisoners serving criminal sentences. If several members of a family are detained, they are to be accommodated separately from other detainees awaiting deportation. They are to be guaranteed an appropriate degree of privacy.

(2) Detainees awaiting deportation are permitted to contact legal representatives, family members, the competent consular authorities and the relevant aid and support organisations.

(3) In the case of minors in custody awaiting deportation, the needs of persons their age are to be taken into account in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in member states for returning illegally staying third-country nationals (OJ L 348, 24.12.2008, p. 98). Particular attention is to be paid to the situation of vulnerable persons.

(4) Upon application, staff of relevant aid and assistance organisations are, as a general rule, to be permitted to visit detainees awaiting deportation.

(5) Detainees awaiting deportation are to be informed of their rights and obligations and the rules applied in the facility.

Section 62b  
Custody to secure departure

(1) Notwithstanding the conditions applicable to custody to secure deportation pursuant to section 62 (3), in particular the existence of a risk of absconding, foreigners may be placed in custody for no more than 28 days by judicial order for the purpose of ensuring that the deportation can be carried out if

1.  the period allowed for departure has expired, unless the foreigner was prevented from leaving through no fault of his or her own or the period allowed for departure has been exceeded by an insignificant amount of time,

2.  it is clear that the deportation can be carried out within this period, and

3.  the foreigner has displayed behaviour which makes it reasonable to expect that he or she will make the deportation more difficult or impossible. This is the case if the foreigner

a)  has violated the statutory obligation to cooperate,

b)  has deceived the authorities as to his or her identity or nationality,

c)  was convicted of a criminal offence intentionally committed in the federal territory, not counting fines totalling up to 50 day fines, or

d)  has exceeded the period allowed for departure by more than 30 days.

No custody to secure departure is to be ordered if the foreigner credibly asserts or it is obvious that he or she does not intend to evade deportation.

(2) Custody to secure departure is enforced in the transit area of an airport or in accommodation from which the foreigner’s subsequent departure is possible.

(3) Section 62 (1) and (4a) and section 62a apply accordingly.

(4) The authority responsible for the application pursuant to subsection (1) may detain a foreigner without a prior judicial order and place such foreigner in temporary custody if

1.  there is a strong suspicion that the conditions pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 apply,

2.  it is not possible to obtain the court ruling on the order for custody to secure departure referred to in subsection (1) beforehand and

3.  there is a well-founded suspicion that the foreigner intends to evade the order for custody to secure departure.

The foreigner is to be brought before the court without delay for a ruling on the order for custody to secure departure.

Section 62c  
Supplementary custody to prepare deportation

(1) Foreigners who are residing in the federal territory in violation of an existing entry and residence ban under section 11 (1) sentence 3 and have no permission to enter the federal territory under section 11 (8) are to be taken into custody by judicial order for the purpose of preparing a deportation warning pursuant to section 34 of the Asylum Act if they constitute a significant threat to the life and limb of others or to significant legally protected interests of internal security or they are subject to expulsion on the ground of a particularly serious public interest in expulsion as referred to in section 54 (1). No custody may be ordered if custody is not necessary to prepare a deportation warning pursuant to section 34 of the Asylum Act.

(2) Custody as referred to in subsection (1) ends when the decision of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees is served but no later than four weeks after the asylum application has been received by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees unless the application was denied as inadmissible under section 29 (1) no. 4 of the Asylum Act or as manifestly unfounded. In cases in which the asylum application was denied as inadmissible under section 29 (1) no. 4 of the Asylum Act or as manifestly unfounded, custody ends according to subsection (1) when the time limit referred to in section 36 (3) sentence 1 of the Asylum Act expires; if the application was filed on time, custody ends with the court ruling. In cases in which the appeal against the deportation warning pursuant to section 80 (5) of the Code of Administrative Court Procedure (_Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung_) has been denied by the administrative court, custody ends no later than one week after the court ruling.

(3) Custody is enforced in specialised detention facilities. If no specialised detention facilities are available in the federal territory, or if the foreigner constitutes a significant threat to the life and limb of others or to significant legally protected internal security interests, custody awaiting deportation may be enforced in other penal institutions; in this case, the foreigner is to be accommodated separately from prisoners serving criminal sentences. Section 62 (1) and section 62a (2) to (5) apply accordingly.

(4) The authority responsible for the detention application may detain a foreigner without a prior judicial order and place such foreigner in temporary custody if

1.  there is a strong suspicion that the conditions referred to in subsection (1) apply,

2.  it is not possible to obtain the court ruling on the order for custody referred to in subsection (1) beforehand and

3.  there is a well-founded suspicion that the foreigner intends to evade the order for custody referred to in subsection (1).

The foreigner is to be brought before the court without delay for a ruling on the order for custody referred to in subsection (1).

Section 62d  
Appointing a legal representative

With regard to the court ruling on the order for custody awaiting deportation pursuant to section 62 and custody to secure departure pursuant to section 62b, the court appoints ex officio a legal representative for the foreigner concerned for the duration of the procedure, if the foreigner does not already have a legal representative.

Section 64  
Return transport obligation of transport carriers

(1) If foreigners are refused entry, the carrier which transported them to the border is required to remove them from the federal territory without delay.

(2) The obligation pursuant to subsection (1) applies for a period of three years with regard to foreigners transported into the federal territory without the necessary passport, passport substitute or the necessary residence title who are not refused entry because they claim political persecution, persecution within the meaning of section 3 (1) of the Asylum Act or the risk of suffering serious harm within the meaning of section 4 (1) of the Asylum Act, or the circumstances referred to in section 60 (2), (3), (5) or (7). The obligation expires if the foreigner is granted a residence title under the terms of this Act.

(3) On request from the authorities charged with policing cross-border traffic, the carrier is required to transport the foreigners to the state which issued the travel document or from which they were transported, or to another state in which their admission is ensured.

Section 66  
Parties liable for costs; security

(1) Costs arising in connection with the enforcement of a geographic restriction, refusal of entry, removal or deportation are to be borne by the foreigner.

(2) In addition to the foreigner, parties who have provided the foreigners authority or the diplomatic mission abroad with a declaration of commitment to bear the costs of the foreigner’s departure are also liable for the costs referred to in subsection (1). If in the cases covered by section 18i an application for an EU Blue Card is denied because the requirements for long-term mobility are not met, the holder of the EU Blue Card and the employer are liable for the costs referred to in subsection (1).

(3) In the cases covered by section 64 (1) and (2), the transport carrier, in addition to the foreigner, is liable for the costs of the foreigner’s return transportation and for the costs which arise from the time the foreigner arrives at the border crossing point until the decision on entry is enforced. A transport carrier who culpably contravenes an order pursuant to section 63 (2) is, in addition to the foreigner, liable for any other costs arising from refused entry in cases covered by section 64 (1) or from deportation in cases covered by section 64 (2).

(4) The following are liable for the costs of deportation or removal:

1.  anyone who has employed a foreigner who was not permitted to pursue the economic activity under the provisions of this Act,

2.  a contractor for whom an employer has performed services as a direct sub-contractor and the contractor was aware or should have been aware, if he or she had exercised due diligence, that the employer hired a foreigner to perform the service who was not permitted to pursue the economic activity under the provisions of this Act,

3.  a prime contractor or intermediate contractor without a direct contractual relationship to the employer who is aware of the employment of a foreigner who was not permitted to pursue the economic activity under the provisions of this Act,

4.  anyone who commits an act punishable under section 96 or participates in an act punishable under section 95;

5.  the foreigner in question, to the extent that such costs cannot be recovered from the other liable parties.

The persons listed in sentence 1 nos. 1 to 4 are liable as joint and several debtors within the meaning of section 421 of the Civil Code.

(4a) Liability pursuant to subsection (4) no. 1 is to be waived if the employer has fulfilled his or her obligations pursuant to section 4a (5) and the notification obligation pursuant to section 28a of Book Four of the Social Code in conjunction with sections 6, 7 and 13 of the Data Collection and Transfer Ordinance (_Datenerfassungs- und -übermittlungsverordnung_) or pursuant to section 18 of the Posted Workers Act (_Arbeitnehmer-Entsendegesetz_), unless the employer was aware that the foreigner’s residence title or the certificate confirming permission to remain pending the asylum decision or confirming suspension of deportation was forged.

(5) The party liable for costs may be required to furnish security. The order for security to be furnished by the foreigner or the party liable for costs pursuant to subsection (4) sentences 1 and 2 may be enforced by the authority which issued the order without a prior writ of execution and without allowing a period for payment, if recovery of the costs would otherwise be at risk. By way of security for the costs relating to the foreigner’s departure from the federal territory, return air tickets and other travel vouchers in the possession of a foreigner who is to be refused entry, removed, expelled or deported or who is permitted to enter and stay in the federal territory solely for the purpose of filing an application for asylum may be confiscated. If there is factual evidence that the foreigner has funds as referred to in sentence 1 or documents as referred to in sentence 3, the foreigner and the objects in his or her possession may be searched for these funds or documents.

Section 68  
Liability for living expenses

(1) Anyone who has provided the foreigners authority or a diplomatic mission abroad with a declaration of commitment to bear a foreigner’s living expenses is required for a period of five years to reimburse all public funds expended to cover the foreigner’s living expenses, including the provision of living space, medical care in case of illness and any required nursing care, and including any such expenditure which is based on a legal entitlement of the foreigner. Expenditures based on the payment of contributions are not to be reimbursed. The period referred to in sentence 1 begins with the foreigner’s entry which the declaration of commitment made possible. The declaration of commitment does not expire before the period of five years from the foreigner’s entry has elapsed if a residence title is granted pursuant to Chapter 2 Division 5 or if recognition is given pursuant to section 3 or section 4 of the Asylum Act.

(2) The declaration of commitment referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1 is to be furnished in writing. It is enforceable in accordance with the Administrative Enforcement Act (_Verwaltungsvollstreckungsgesetz_). The public body which has expended the public funds is entitled to the reimbursement.

(3) The diplomatic mission abroad is to notify the foreigners authority immediately of a declaration of commitment as referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1.

(4) When it becomes aware of the expenditure of public funds to be reimbursed pursuant to subsection (1), the foreigners authority notifies the public body entitled to the reimbursement immediately as to the declaration of commitment pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1, and furnishes that body with all the information necessary to assert and enforce the reimbursement claim. The recipient may only use the data for the purpose of reimbursing the public funds expended for the foreigner and refusing further benefits.

Section 69  
Fees

(1) Fees and expenses are charged for individually attributable public services rendered under this Act and the statutory instruments issued to enforce this Act. Fees may also be set orally. Sentence 1 does not apply to individually attributable public services rendered by the Federal Employment Agency under sections 39 to 42. Section 287 of Book Three of the Social Code remains unaffected. Furthermore, sentence 1 does not apply to the notification procedure in connection with the short-term mobility of students under section 16c, intra-corporate transferees under section 19a or of researchers under section 18e.

(2) As a general rule, the fee is to cover the costs related to the individually attributable public service of all those involved in the service. The fee is to include the expenses regularly related to the service. The fees are to be calculated based on the costs which are eligible, according to business principles, for inclusion in the accounts as indirect and overhead costs, especially personnel and material costs and imputed costs. Overhead costs also include the costs of legal and technical supervision. The fees referred to in sentences 1 to 4 are calculated based on the costs arising for the _Länder_ and the Federation in the context of the service in question.

(3) The Federal Government determines, via statutory instrument with the approval of the Bundesrat, the cases which are subject to a fee, the scales of fees, and exemptions and reduced fees, particularly in cases of need. Section 3 (1) nos. 1 and 4, (2) and (4) to (6), sections 4 to 7 nos. 1 to 10, sections 8, 9 (3), sections 10 to 12 (1) sentence 1, and (3) as well as sections 13 to 21 of the Act on Fees and Expenses for Federal Services (_Bundesgebührengesetz_) of 7 August 2013 (Federal Law Gazette I, p. 3154) apply as amended, unless this Act provides otherwise.

(4) In derogation from section 4 (1) of the Act on Fees and Expenses for Federal Services, the fees to be charged by the diplomatic missions abroad may be charged at the time of application. With regard to the fees to be charged by the diplomatic missions abroad, the Federal Foreign Office determines whether the fees will be charged in euros, in local currency or in a third currency. The fee may be rounded to the next highest unit, depending on the general availability of units in the selected currency.

(5) The fees which are fixed in the statutory instrument may not exceed the following maximum rates:

1.  for issuing a temporary residence permit: 140 euros,

1a.  for issuing an EU Blue Card: 140 euros,

1b.  for issuing an ICT Card: 140 euros,

1c.  for issuing a Mobile ICT Card: 100 euros,

2.  for issuing a permanent settlement permit: 200 euros,

2a.  for issuing an EU long-term residence permit: 200 euros,

3.  for extending a temporary residence permit, an EU Blue Card or an ICT Card: 100 euros,

3a.  for extending a Mobile ICT Card: 80 euros,

4.  for issuing a national visa and a passport substitute and substitute identity document: 100 euros,

5.  for recognising a research organisation for the purpose of concluding hosting agreements or an equivalent contract pursuant to section 18d: 220 euros,

6.  for other individually attributable public services: 80 euros,

7.  for other individually attributable public services rendered for the benefit of minors: half the fee determined for the public service,

8.  for issuing a new document pursuant to section 78 (1) which has become necessary due to a change in the information under section 78 (1) sentence 3, or due to the expiry of the technical period of validity for the use of the card, the loss of the document or the loss of the technical functionality of the document: 70 euros,

9.  for suspending, reducing or extending time limits attached to a ban on entry and residence: 200 euros.

(6) A surcharge of no more than 25 euros may be imposed to issue a national visa and a passport substitute at the border. A surcharge of no more than 30 euros may be imposed for an individually attributable public service rendered outside of normal office hours at the request of the applicant. Surcharges may also be imposed for individually attributable public services rendered for a national whose home country imposes fees in excess of those stipulated in subsection (3) on Germans for equivalent services. Sentences 2 and 3 do not apply to issuing or extending a Schengen visa. In setting surcharges, the maximum rates stipulated in subsection (5) may be exceeded.

(7) The statutory instrument pursuant to subsection (3) may provide for a processing fee to be charged for applications for individually attributable public services which are subject to fees. The fee for processing an application for a permanent settlement permit or an EU long-term residence permit may not exceed half the fee charged for issuing the permit. This fee is to be offset against the fee for the individually attributable public service. The fee will not be refunded if the application is withdrawn or if the individually attributable public service which is applied for is denied.

(8) The statutory instrument pursuant to subsection (3) may provide for fees to be charged to file an objection; the following maximum rates apply to such fees:

1.  to object to the denial of an application for an individually attributable public service which is subject to a fee: half the fee set for the service,

2.  to object to another individually attributable public service: 55 euros.

If the objection is successful, the fee is to be deducted from the fee for the individually attributable public service to be performed and the remainder is to be refunded.

Section 70  
Limitation of actions in respect of claims

(1) The claims for the costs specified in section 67 (1) and (2) become statute-barred six years after they become due for payment.

(2) The limitation period for claims pursuant to sections 66 and 69 is also interrupted for as long as the party liable for costs is not resident in the federal territory or for as long as that party’s residence in the federal territory cannot be ascertained because he or she has failed to meet a statutory registration or notification obligation.

Section 71  
Competence

(1) The foreigners authorities are responsible for residence- and passport-related measures and decisions pursuant to this Act and pursuant to provisions relating to foreigners in other acts. The _Land_ government or the body appointed by it may determine that only one or several specific foreigners authorities are responsible for specific tasks. Pursuant to sentence 2, the competent bodies of the _Länder_ in question may arrange for the foreigners authorities of a _Land_ to be assigned tasks for the districts of foreigners authorities of various _Länder_. Each _Land_ is to designate a central body responsible for enforcing deportations.

(2) Outside of Germany, the diplomatic missions authorised by the Federal Foreign Office are responsible for matters relating to passports and visas. The Federal Foreign Office is authorised to issue a statutory instrument in agreement with the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community delegating decisions on visa applications to the Federal Agency for Foreign Affairs. As far as the Federal Foreign Office makes use of this authority, the Federal Agency for Foreign Affairs has the authority to process data and carry out all other tasks and the powers of a German diplomatic mission abroad in granting visas in accordance with subsection (3) (b) and in accordance with sections 54, 66, 68, 69, 72, 72a, 73, 73a, 75, 87, 90c, 91d and 91g.

(3) The authorities charged with policing cross-border traffic are responsible for

1.  removal and refusal of entry at the border, including the transfer of third-country nationals on the basis of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 if the foreigner is intercepted by the border authority in the vicinity of the border and in close chronological proximity to an unlawful entry into the federal territory,

7.  acquiring return travel documents for foreigners in individual cases by means of administrative assistance,

8.  issuing notes and certificates provided for in legislation of the European Union confirming the date and place of entry via the external border of a member state which applies the Schengen acquis in full; this does not preclude the competence of the foreigners authorities or other bodies designated by the _Länder_.

(4) The foreigners authorities, the _Länder_ police authorities and, in carrying out their legally mandated duties, the Federal Police and other authorities charged with policing cross-border traffic are responsible for the measures necessary under sections 48, 48a and 49 (2) to (9). The authorities initiating allocation pursuant to section 15a are also responsible in cases covered by section 49 (4). The diplomatic missions abroad authorised by the Federal Foreign Office are also responsible in the cases covered by section 49 (5) nos. 5 and 6. In the cases covered by section 49 (8) and (9), the reception centres referred to in section 44 of the Asylum Act and the branch offices of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees are also authorised by way of administrative assistance to carry out measures to identify foreign children or juveniles who entered the federal territory unaccompanied; as a rule, these measures are to be carried out in the presence of the youth welfare office, after it has been informed to take the child or young person temporarily into care, and in a child-appropriate manner.

(5) The police forces of the _Länder_ are also responsible for removal, for enforcing the obligation to leave the federal territory pursuant to section 12 (3), for deportation and, where necessary to prepare and safeguard these measures, for arrests and for applying for custody.

Section 71a  
Jurisdiction and notification

(1) In the cases covered by section 98 (2a) no. 1 and (3) no. 1, the administrative authorities within the meaning of section 36 (1) no. 1 of the Administrative Offences Act (_Gesetz über Ordnungswidrigkeiten_) are the customs administration authorities. They cooperate with the authorities referred to in section 2 (4) of the Act to Combat Clandestine Employment in prosecuting offences and imposing punishments.

(2) The customs administration authorities notify the Central Trade and Industry Register as to incontestable orders imposing administrative fines pursuant to section 98 (2a) no. 1 and (3) no. 1 which are to be entered in the register. This applies only to fines of more than 200 euros.

(3) As a rule, courts of law, prosecuting authorities and penal authorities are to furnish the customs administration authorities with findings from other proceedings which they consider necessary in prosecuting administrative offences under section 98 (2a) no. 1 and (3) no. 1, unless it is apparent to the body furnishing such information that the legitimate interests of the data subject or other parties involved in the proceedings in excluding such information prevail. Due consideration must be accorded to how well substantiated the findings to be communicated are.

Section 72  
Obligation to consult

(1) Permission to enter the federal territory (section 11 (8)) may only be granted with the consent of the foreigners authority responsible for the intended place of residence. As a rule, the authority which has expelled, removed or deported the foreigner must be consulted.

(2) The foreigners authority decides whether deportation to a specific state is prohibited pursuant to section 60 (5) or (7) and whether grounds for exclusion exist pursuant to section 25 (3) sentence 3 nos. 1 to 4 only after consulting the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees.

(3) Geographic restrictions, requirements and conditions, time limits pursuant to section 11 (2) sentence 1, orders pursuant to section 47 and other measures concerning a foreigner who does not possess a required residence title may be amended or removed by a different authority only in agreement with the authority which ordered the measures. Sentence 1 does not apply if the foreigner’s residence is restricted to the region for which the other foreigners authority is responsible in accordance with the Asylum Act.

(3a) A residence restriction under section 12a (5) may be removed only with the consent of the foreigners authority responsible for the place where the foreigner plans to reside. Consent is to be given if the conditions of section 12a (5) are met; reasons are to be given for any refusal. Consent is deemed to have been given if the foreigners authority at the place where the foreigner plans to reside does not respond to the contrary within four weeks of receiving the request. Compliance with obligations under law on registration does not establish jurisdiction of a foreigners authority.

(4) A foreigner against whom legal proceedings are instituted by a public authority or preliminary investigations are instituted under criminal law may be expelled or deported only in agreement with the competent public prosecutor’s office. A foreigner who qualifies as requiring protection within the meaning of the Act to Harmonise Protection for Witnesses (_Zeugenschutz-Harmonisierungsgesetz_) may be expelled or deported only in agreement with the Office for the Protection of Witnesses. The consent of the public prosecutor’s office pursuant to sentence 1 is not required if there is only minimal interest in the prosecution. This is the case where public charges were brought or a preliminary investigation initiated for a criminal offence pursuant to section 95 of this Act or pursuant to section 9 of the Act on the General Freedom of Movement of EU Citizens (_Gesetz über die allgemeine Freizügigkeit von Unionsbürgern_) or offences pursuant to the Criminal Code involving a minimal level of wrongdoing. Offences involving a minimal level of wrongdoing are those referred to in section 113 (1), section 115 of the Criminal Code (insofar as section 115 provides for the application of section 113 (1) of the Criminal Code), sections 123, 166, 167, 169, 185, 223, 240 (1), sections 242, 246, 248b, 263 (1), (2) and (4), sections 265a, 267 (1) and (2), section 271 (1), (2) and (4), sections 273, 274, 276 (1), sections 279, 281, 303 of the Criminal Code, section 21 of the Road Traffic Act (_Straßenverkehrsgesetz_) in the version published on 5 March 2003 (Federal Law Gazette I, p. 310, 919), last amended by Article 16 of the Act of 2 March 2023 (Federal Law Gazette 2023 I, no. 56), as amended, in the applicable version, and section 30 of the Compulsory Insurance Act (_Pflichtversicherungsgesetz_).

(5) Section 45 of Book Eight of the Social Code does not apply to departure facilities and facilities which serve as temporary accommodation for foreigners who are granted a temporary residence permit for reasons of international law or on humanitarian or political grounds or whose deportation is suspended.

(6) The public prosecutor’s office responsible for the criminal proceedings referred to in section 25 (4a) or (4b) or the criminal court concerned with such proceedings is to be consulted before reaching a decision on issuing, extending or revoking a residence title pursuant to section 25 (4a) or (4b) and before setting, annulling or reducing a period allowed for leaving the country pursuant to section 59 (7), except in cases covered by section 87 (5) no. 1. If the foreigners authority does not yet know which public prosecutor’s office is responsible, the foreigners authority consults the police authority responsible for the place of residence before reaching a decision on setting, annulling or reducing a period allowed for leaving the country pursuant to section 59 (7).

(7) To determine whether the conditions of sections 16a, 16d, 16e, 16g, 18a, 18b, 18c (3), 18g and sections 19 to 19c are met, the foreigners authority, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees and the diplomatic mission abroad may consult the Federal Employment Agency even if its consent is not required.

Section 72a  
Security check of visa application data

(1) Data collected during the visa application process by a German diplomatic mission abroad on the visa applicant, the inviting party, persons guaranteeing that the foreigner’s subsistence will be ensured by making a declaration of commitment or by other means, or on other reference persons in Germany are transmitted to the Federal Office of Administration for a security check. The same applies to data pursuant to sentence 1 which the diplomatic mission abroad of another Schengen state responsible under Article 8 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code) (OJ L 243, 15.9.2009, p. 1) has transmitted to a German diplomatic mission abroad for a decision on a visa application. Data are not transmitted pursuant to sentence 1 or sentence 2 if the data are transmitted pursuant to section 73 (1) sentence 1.

(2) The data referred to in subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2 are checked in a special organisational unit of the Federal Office of Administration in an automated procedure against data stored in the file referred to in section1 (1) of the Act on Setting up a Counter-Terrorism Database (_Antiterrordateigesetz_) regarding persons when there is reason to believe that they

1.  are members or supporters of a terrorist organisation as referred to in section 129a of the Criminal Code acting at an international level or of a terrorist organisation as referred to in section 129a in conjunction with section 129b (1) sentence 1 of the Criminal Code acting in the Federal Republic of Germany or

2.  are members of a group which supports such an organisation or intentionally supports such a group in the knowledge of the activities of the group which support terrorism or

3.  unlawfully use violence as a means of enforcing international political or religious interests or support or prepare such use of violence or intentionally incite others to use violence by means of their activities, in particular through advocating such use of violence, or

4.  are in contact with the persons referred to in no. 1 or no. 3 not only fleetingly or by chance and it is expected that they will yield further information which may help in solving or combating international terrorism insofar as there is reason to believe that they are aware of the planning or commission of one of the criminal offences referred to in no. 1 or the use, support for or preparation of unlawful violence within the meaning of no. 3.

After the authority which stored the data on persons referred to in sentence 1 in the Counter-Terrorism Database has labelled these data, the Federal Criminal Police Office transfers the data to the special organisational unit at the Federal Office of Administration for the check against data referred to in subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2, and the data are stored there. Suitable technical and organisational measures as required by Articles 24, 25 and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are to be taken to prevent unauthorised access to the content of the data sets.

(3) In the event of a hit, in order to ascertain the grounds for denial pursuant to section 5 (4) or to investigate other security reservations against issuing a visa, the data referred to in subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2 are transmitted to the authorities which stored the data on this person in the Counter-Terrorism Database. These authorities immediately notify the competent German diplomatic mission abroad via the Federal Office of Administration if there are grounds to deny the visa pursuant to section 5 (4) or there are other security reservations against issuing a visa.

(4) The data referred to in subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2, which have been stored with the special organisational unit in the Federal Office of Administration, are deleted immediately after carrying out the check pursuant to subsection (2) sentence 1; if the check produced a hit, only the visa file reference is stored. This is deleted as soon as the special organisational unit in the Federal Office of Administration has established that the German diplomatic mission abroad is not to be notified pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 2, or when the notification has been made.

(5) The authorities referred to in subsection (3) sentence 1 may process the data transmitted to them as far as necessary to discharge their statutory duties. Provisions regulating the transmission of data pursuant to other acts remain unaffected.

(6) In the event of a hit, the Federal Office of Administration ensures that the time of the security check, the particulars which enable the determination of the checked data sets, the result of the check, the forwarding of the data set and the processing of the data set for the purpose of data protection monitoring are logged. The log data are to be secured by means of suitable measures to prevent unauthorised access and are to be destroyed at the end of the calendar year which follows the year of their generation, unless they are needed for a monitoring procedure which has already been initiated.

(7) The Federal Office of Administration is to undertake state-of-the-art technical and organisational measures in accordance with Articles 24, 25 and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to ensure data protection and data security which, in particular, safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored in the special organisational unit and transmitted.

(8) Responsibility under data protection law for ensuring that the conditions of subsection (2) sentence 1 are met lies with the authority which entered the data in the Counter-Terrorism Database. Responsibility under data protection law for the security check lies with the Federal Office of Administration. The Federal Criminal Police Office is responsible under data protection law for ensuring that the transmitted data reflect the current status of the Counter-Terrorism Database.

(9) The data referred to in subsection (2) sentence 2 are to be corrected if they are corrected in the Counter-Terrorism Database. They are deleted if the conditions for their storage pursuant to subsection (2) sentence 1 are no longer met or the data are deleted in the Counter-Terrorism Database. Section 11 (4) of the Act on Setting up a Counter-Terrorism Database applies accordingly to examining whether the conditions permitting storage of the data pursuant to subsection (2) sentence 2 continue to be met.

The data referred to in sentence 1 may be transmitted via the Federal Office of Administration to the security authorities and intelligence services listed in sentence 1 to ascertain the grounds for denial referred to in sentence 1 or to investigate any other security reservations and to determine whether the conditions for revocation or withdrawal pursuant to sections 73 to 73b of the Asylum Act are met. Data to document, establish and verify identity

1.  collected pursuant to section 16 (1) sentence 1 of the Asylum Act or section 49 (5) no. 5, subsections (8) and (9) or transmitted under Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 from another member state to the Federal Republic of Germany concerning persons whom another member state has asked the Federal Republic of Germany to take charge of or take back under Regulation (EU) No 604/2013,

2.  collected pursuant to section 49 (5) no. 6 on persons proposed for admission procedures under section 23 or for temporary protection under section 24 and have been included in the examination of cases for granting approval for admission by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, or

3.  collected pursuant to section 49 (5) no. 6 or transmitted by another member state to the Federal Republic of Germany on persons to be allocated in the federal territory on the basis of measures under Article 78 (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and included in the examination of cases for granting approval for admission by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees

may be transmitted via the Federal Office of Administration to the security authorities and intelligence services listed in sentence 1 to ascertain grounds for denial or to investigate any other security reservations. Together with the data referred to in sentence 1, the data referred to in section 3 (1) nos. 1 and 3 of the Act on the Central Register of Foreigners, information on moving to or from Germany and on status under residence law, and data referred to in section 3 (2) nos. 6 and 9 of the Act on the Central Register of Foreigners on persons referred to in sentence 1 may be transmitted to the Federal Criminal Police Office to discharge their statutory duties. A check against other data sets at the Federal Office of Administration is also permitted for the purposes referred to in sentences 1 to 3.

(2) Before issuing or extending a residence title, temporarily suspending deportation or permitting residence pending the asylum decision, the foreigners authorities may transmit the personal data stored at their facilities on the persons concerned via the Federal Office of Administration to the Federal Intelligence Service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the Military Counter-Intelligence Service, the Federal Criminal Police Office, the Federal Police, the Customs Criminological Office, the _Land_ Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the _Land_ Office of Criminal Police or the competent police authorities in order to ascertain any grounds for denial pursuant to section 5 (4) or in order to investigate any other security reservations. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution may provide technical support for the transmission of data to the _Land_ offices for the protection of the Constitution.

(3) The security authorities and intelligence services referred to in subsections (1) and (2) immediately notify the Federal Office of Administration as to whether grounds for denial pursuant to section 5 (4) or any other security reservations apply; the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution may provide technical support for the transmission of information from the _Land_ offices for the protection of the Constitution regarding enquiries from the foreigners authorities pursuant to subsection (2). The German diplomatic missions abroad and foreigners authorities immediately inform the security authorities and intelligence services referred to in sentence 1 of the length of validity of the residence titles which have been issued or extended; if the authorities referred to in sentence 1 become aware of grounds for denial pursuant to section 5 (4) or other security reservations during the period of validity of the residence title, they immediately notify the competent foreigners authority or the competent diplomatic mission abroad. The authorities referred to in sentence 1 may process the data transmitted to them as far as necessary to discharge their statutory duties. Provisions regulating the transmission of data under other acts remain unaffected.

(3a) The security authorities and intelligence services referred to in subsection (1a) immediately notify the Federal Office of Administration of any grounds for denial pursuant to section 3 (2), section 4 (2) of the Asylum Act, section 60 (8) sentence 1 or section 5 (4) or of other security reservations. The Federal Office of Administration promptly makes this information available to the authorities responsible for the asylum procedure and for decisions on residence matters.

The further transmission of data between the authorities referred to in sentence 1 and the authorities responsible for the asylum procedure and for decisions on residence matters which is required as a result of the transmission pursuant to subsection (1a) and sentences 1 and 2 may be effected via the Federal Office of Administration. The authorities referred to in sentence 1 may process the data transmitted to them as far as necessary to discharge their statutory duties. The Federal Office of Administration stores the transmitted data for as long as necessary for the purposes of the security check. The Federal Criminal Police Office immediately checks whether the data transmitted pursuant to subsection (1a) sentence 4 on the person in question match the personal data stored at the Federal Criminal Police Office on a person who is the subject of an alert. If this is not the case, the Federal Criminal Police Office is to delete immediately the data transmitted pursuant to subsection (1a) sentence 4 on the person in question. Results of checks pursuant to subsection (1a) sentence 5 intended to verify, establish or document identity may be transmitted to the authorities responsible for registration and the asylum procedure, the authorities responsible for decisions on residence matters and to the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police and the competent police authorities. Provisions regulating the transmission of data under other acts remain unaffected.

(3b) The security authorities and intelligence services referred to in subsection (1) immediately notify the Federal Office of Administration as to whether grounds for denial pursuant to section 27 (3a) exist.

The same applies to the notice of intention to deport and subsequent deportation to the country of origin, if his or her legal representative is not resident in the federal territory or the latter’s whereabouts in the federal territory are unknown.

(3) In applying this Act, the provisions of the Civil Code determine whether a foreigner is regarded as a minor or an adult. If a foreigner is of age under the law of his or her home country, the foreigner’s legal capacity and capacity to contract remain unaffected.

(4) The legal representatives of a minor foreigner and any other persons attending to the foreigner in the federal territory in place of the legal representatives are required to file the necessary applications on behalf of the foreigner for issuing and extending the residence title and issuing and extending the passport, passport substitute and substitute identity document.

(5) Where the foreigner is under 18 years of age, the persons entitled to the foreigner’s care and custody must consent to any planned stay in accordance with Chapter 2 Divisions 3 and 4.

Section 81  
Applying for a residence title

(1) In the absence of any provisions to the contrary, a residence title is issued to a foreigner only upon application by said foreigner.

(2) A residence title which may be obtained after entering the federal territory in accordance with the statutory instrument under section 99 (1) no. 2 must be applied for immediately after entry or within the period stipulated in the statutory instrument. The application for a child born in the federal territory who is not to be granted a residence title ex officio is to be filed within six months of birth.

(3) If a foreigner who is legally resident in the federal territory and does not possess a residence title applies for a residence title, his or her residence is deemed to be permitted up to the time of the decision by the foreigners authority. If the application is filed too late, deportation is deemed to be suspended from the time of application up to the time of the decision by the foreigners authority.

(4) If a foreigner applies for an extension of his or her residence title or for a different residence title before his or her current residence title expires, the current residence title is deemed to remain in force from the time it expires until the time of the decision by the foreigners authority. This does not apply to visas issued in accordance with section 6 (1). If the application to issue or extend a residence title was filed too late, the foreigners authority may order that the previous residence title remains valid in order to avoid undue hardship.

(5) The foreigner is to be issued with a certificate confirming the effect of the application (provisional residence document).

(5a) In the cases of subsections (3) and (4), the economic activity described in the future residence title for residence pursuant to Chapter 2 Divisions 3 and 4 is deemed to be permitted from the time the document is requested until it is handed over in accordance with section 78 (1) sentence 1. The permission to pursue an economic activity pursuant to sentence 1 is to be included in the certificate referred to in subsection (5).

(6) If the application for a temporary residence permit allowing the subsequent immigration of dependants wishing to join the holder of an ICT Card, a Mobile ICT Card or an EU Blue Card is filed at the same time as the application for an ICT Card, a Mobile ICT Card or an EU Blue Card, the application for the temporary residence permit allowing the subsequent immigration of dependants is decided upon at the same time as this application. As a rule, the same applies if the application for a temporary residence permit allowing the subsequent immigration of dependants wishing to join the holder of a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 18a or section 18b is filed at the same time as the application for a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 18a or section 18b. If immediately before being granted the EU Blue Card, the holder of the EU Blue Card had an EU Blue Card issued by another member state of the European Union, the family unit already existed in the other member state of the European Union, and the application is filed at the same time, but the dependants do not enter the federal territory until after the EU Blue Card is granted, the temporary residence permit allowing the subsequent immigration of dependants is to be granted no more than 30 days after the submission of the complete application. In justified exceptional cases, the time limit may be extended by 30 days.

(6a) If the foreigner has an EU Blue Card which was issued by another member state of the European Union, the applicant and the other member state of the European Union are notified of the decision on the application to grant an EU Blue Card no more than 30 days after the submission of the complete application. In justified exceptional cases, the time limit may be extended by 30 days. The applicant is to be informed no more than 30 days after the submission of the complete application if the time limit is to be extended. No more than 30 days after the submission of the complete application, the holder of the EU Blue Card may pursue employment if he or she has been authorised to work in that occupation.

(7) If the foreigner’s identity is to be verified using identification measures in accordance with section 49 of this Act or section 16 of the Asylum Act, then a provisional residence document as referred to in subsection (5) may only be issued or a residence title may only be granted if the identification measures have been conducted and the data collected from the measure have been stored in the Central Register of Foreigners (_Ausländerzentralregister_).

Section 81a  
Fast-track procedure for skilled workers

(1) On behalf of a foreigner wishing to enter the country for one of the purposes of residence listed in sections 16a, 16d, 18a, 18b, 18c (3) and section 18g, employers may apply for a fast-track procedure. Employers may authorise third parties to carry out the procedure.

(2) To this end, the employer and the competent foreigners authority conclude an agreement comprising the following in particular:

1.  contact details of the foreigner, employer and authority

2.  the fact that the foreigner has authorised the employer to act on his or her behalf

3.  the fact that the competent foreigners authority has been authorised by the employer to initiate and carry out the procedure to establish the equivalence of the occupational qualification the foreigner acquired abroad,

4.  the fact that the employer must take steps to make the foreigner comply with his or her obligation to cooperate as set out in section 82 (1) sentence 1,

5.  documents to be submitted,

6.  description of the process, including the parties involved and deadlines to be kept,

7.  the employer’s obligation to cooperate under section 4a (5) sentence 3 no. 3, and

8.  consequences of failure to comply with the agreement.

(3) As part of the fast-track procedure for skilled workers it is the responsibility of the competent foreigners authority to

1.  advise the employer as regards the procedure and the documents to be submitted,

2.  initiate with the competent body the procedure for establishing the equivalence of the occupational qualification acquired abroad or for assessing the foreign higher education qualification, where necessary, indicating that this is part of the fast-track procedure for skilled workers; if the aim is to employ the foreigner in a regulated occupation in Germany, the authorisation to work in an occupation must be obtained,

2a.  if necessary, initiate a procedure with a competent Germany authority to confirm that the foreigner

a)  has a foreign occupational qualification which is officially recognised by the country where it was acquired and which can only be acquired after completing training which takes at least two years, or

b)  holds a foreign higher education qualification which is officially recognised in the country where it was acquired,

c)  indicating that this is part of the fast-track procedure for skilled workers; if the foreigner is to be employed in a regulated occupation in Germany, the necessary authorisation to work in that occupation must be obtained,

3.  in cases where a procedure under no. 2 was initiated, send the employer without delay any notifications by the competent bodies stating that they have received the relevant documents and that these are complete; if the competent body needs more documents and if the employer has received an assessment by the competent body, the employer is to be invited within three working days of receipt in order to be handed the assessment and discuss any further steps to be taken,

4.  obtain, where necessary, the consent of the Federal Employment Agency, indicating that this is part of the fast-track procedure for skilled workers,

5.  inform the competent diplomatic mission abroad that the foreigner is about to apply for a visa, and

6.  agree in advance to granting the visa without delay, provided the necessary requirements are met, which includes determining the equivalence or the comparability of the occupational qualification and the consent of the Federal Employment Agency.

If the competent authority issues a notification determining that the occupational qualification abroad is not equivalent but that equivalence can be achieved by taking part in a qualification measure, the procedure described in section 81a may be continued, the aim being the entry for the purpose under section 16d.

(4) This procedure also covers the subsequent immigration of spouses or minor, unmarried children whose visa applications are submitted around the same time.

(5) Subsections (1) to (4) also apply to other qualified employees.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p1898)

Section 82  
Cooperation by the foreigner

(1) The foreigner is required to put forward his or her interests and any circumstances in his or her favour which are not evident or known, specifying verifiable circumstances, and to produce forthwith the necessary evidence relating to his or her personal situation, other required certificates and permits and other required documents which the foreigner is able to furnish. The foreigners authority may set the foreigner a reasonable deadline for this purpose. It sets him or her such a deadline when postponing the processing of an application for a residence title on account of lacking or incomplete information and specifies the information to be furnished subsequently. Circumstances put forward and documents furnished after said deadline has expired may be ignored. Foreigners who have applied for an ICT Card under section 19 are required to inform the competent foreigners authority of any changes that occur during the application procedure and affect the conditions for granting an ICT Card. During the first 12 months since starting employment with the EU Blue Card, holders of an EU Blue Card are required to inform the competent foreigners authority of any change in employers and any changes that affect the conditions for granting an EU Blue Card.

(2) Subsection (1) applies accordingly in an objection procedure.

(3) As a rule, foreigners are to be notified of the obligations arising from subsection (1) and of their main rights and duties arising from this Act, in particular the obligations arising from sections 44a, 48, 49 and 81. If a time limit is set, the foreigner is to be informed of the consequences of failure to observe the set deadline.

(4) Where necessary to prepare and implement measures under this Act and in accordance with provisions relating to foreigners in other acts, an order may be issued requiring a foreigner to report in person to the competent authority and to the diplomatic missions or authorised officials of the state whose nationality he or she putatively possesses, to provide the information needed to establish his or her identity and to undergo a medical examination to determine whether the foreigner is fit to travel. If a foreigner fails to comply with an order pursuant to sentence 1, the order may be enforced using direct force. Section 40 (1) and (2), sections 41, 42 (1) sentences 1 and 3 of the Act on the Federal Police apply accordingly.

(5) On request, the foreigner for whom a document is to be issued in accordance with this Act, the Asylum Act or the provisions enacted to implement this Act must

1.  submit a current photograph in accordance with a statutory instrument enacted pursuant to section 99 (1) nos. 13 and 13a or to cooperate in the taking of such a photograph and

2.  cooperate in the taking of his or her fingerprints in accordance with a statutory instrument enacted pursuant to section 99 (1) nos. 13 and 13a.

The photograph and the fingerprints may be incorporated into documents pursuant to sentence 1 and processed and used by the competent authorities to document and subsequently establish the foreigner’s identity.

(6) Foreigners who hold a temporary residence permit under Chapter 2 Divisions 3 or 4 and whose vocational training or economic activity for which the residence title was granted ends earlier than planned must inform the competent foreigners authority within two weeks of becoming aware of the termination. The foreigner is to be informed of the obligation under sentence 1 when the residence title is issued.

Section 83  
Limits on the right of appeal

(2) The refusal to suspend deportation is not contestable.

(3) The ordering of and imposition of a time limit on a ban on entry and residence by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees is not contestable.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p1912)

Section 84  
Effects of an objection and legal action

(1) An objection or legal action against

1.  the denial of an application to issue or extend a residence title,

1a.  measures under section 49,

1b.  orders of geographic restrictions pursuant to section 61 (1c),

1c.  orders of residence restrictions as pursuant to section 61 (1d),

1d.  orders to furnish security pursuant to section 66 (5),

2.  conditions imposed in accordance with section 61 (1f) requiring the foreigner to take up residence at a departure facility,

2a.  conditions imposed to secure and enforce the enforceable obligation to leave the country under section 61 (1e),

3.  the amendment or rescission of an ancillary provision concerning the pursuit of an economic activity,

4.  revocation of the foreigner’s residence title pursuant to section 52 (1) sentence 1 no. 4 in the cases covered by section 75 (2) sentence 1 of the Asylum Act,

5.  revocation or withdrawal of the recognition of research organisations for the purpose of concluding hosting agreements under section 18d,

6.  denials of departure under section 46 (2) sentence 1, orders and imposition of a time limit on a ban on entry and residence under section 11, and

7.  the determination under section 85a (1) sentence 2 have no suspensive effect.

(2) Notwithstanding their suspensive effect, an objection or legal action does not alter the operative effect of an expulsion or any other administrative act terminating lawful residence. For purposes pertaining to admission or the pursuit of an economic activity, the residence title is deemed to remain in force until the deadline for raising an objection or instituting legal action expires, during judicial proceedings concerning a permissible application for the institution or restoration of suspensive effect or for as long as the submitted legal remedy has a suspensive effect. The lawfulness of residence is not interrupted if the administrative act is revoked by an official decision or by an incontestable court ruling.

Section 85  
Calculation of residence periods

Interruptions of lawful residence of up to one year may be ignored.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p1929)

Section 85a  
Proceedings in case of specific indications of wrongful acknowledgement of paternity

(1) If an administrative authority recording the acknowledgement or a registry clerk informs the foreigners authority that there are specific indications that paternity has been wrongfully acknowledged within the meaning of section 1597a (1) of the Civil Code, the foreigners authority examines whether such wrongful acknowledgement exists. If it is established that paternity was wrongfully acknowledged, the foreigners authority determines this through a written or electronic administrative act. If it is established that paternity was not wrongfully acknowledged, the foreigners authority discontinues the proceedings.

(2) As a rule, persons are assumed to have wrongfully acknowledged paternity if

1.  the acknowledging party declares that the acknowledgement serves a specific purpose within the meaning of section 1597a (1) of the Civil Code,

2.  the mother declares that the acknowledgement serves a specific purpose within the meaning of section 1597a (1) of the Civil Code,

3.  the party acknowledging paternity has acknowledged paternity, in several instances, of children from different foreign mothers and in each case has created the legal prerequisites for the permitted entry or the permitted residence of the child or of the mother by so acknowledging paternity, also in those cases in which the child has acquired German nationality by the acknowledgement,

4.  the party acknowledging paternity or the mother has been granted or promised a material benefit in return for acknowledging paternity or for approving the acknowledgement,

and it is not to be expected that the legal prerequisites for the permitted entry or the permitted residence of the child, of the acknowledging party or the mother will be met without the acknowledgement of paternity or the mother’s approval of the acknowledgement. This also applies if the legal prerequisites for the permitted entry or the permitted residence of the child are to be met by the child’s acquisition of German nationality under section 4 (1) or (3) sentence 1 of the Nationality Act.

(3) If the determination pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2 is incontestable, the foreigners authority furnishes the administrative authority recording acknowledgements or the registry clerk and the registry office with a certified copy for their information, indicating that the determination has become incontestable. If the authority discontinues the proceedings, it informs the administrative authority recording acknowledgements, the parties concerned and the registry office in written or electronic form.

(4) The German diplomatic missions abroad are responsible for measures and determinations taken or made under subsections (1) and (3) abroad.

Section 86  
Collection of personal data

The authorities charged with implementing this Act may collect personal data for the purpose of implementing this Act and provisions relating to foreigners contained in other acts, where this is necessary to discharge their duties under this Act and in accordance with provisions relating to foreigners in other acts. Personal data which may not be processed under Article 9 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 may be collected to the extent necessary in the individual case for the authorities to discharge their duties.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p1942)

Section 86a  
Collection of personal data to promote voluntary departure and reintegration

(1) The foreigners authorities and all other public or private bodies which carry out publicly funded measures to promote return and reintegration or conduct such measures as commissioned by public sector bodies or receive the necessary application collect personal data to the extent that the data are necessary for the purposes listed in sentence 2. The data are collected

1.  to carry out measures to promote return and reintegration,

2.  to coordinate programmes by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees to promote voluntary returns, and

3.  to make sure that the funds are used properly and of claiming their repayment if this is not the case. The following data are collected:

–  surname, name at birth, given names, spelling of the names according to German law, marital status, date of birth, place and district of birth, sex, doctoral degree, nationalities,

–  information about the country of destination specified in the funding measure,

–  information about the type of funding, and

–  information as to whether the person departed voluntarily, was deported or removed, as well as information as to whether the person is subject to expulsion.

Information about the scope of funding and the reasons for it must also be collected. The data are to be retained for no longer than 10 years.

(2) To be able to assess the effectiveness of promoting departure, the foreigners authorities and the authorities in charge of border police tasks collect information proving that the person concerned left the country and information about the country of departure and country of destination.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p1953)

Section 87  
Transfer of data and information to foreigners authorities

(1) On request, public bodies with the exception of schools and other educational and care establishments for young people inform the bodies specified in section 86 sentence 1 of circumstances of which they become aware, as far as necessary for the purposes referred to in that section. Such requests are only permissible if retrieving data from the Central Register of Foreigners is not sufficient to accomplish the task concerned.

(2) Public bodies within the meaning of subsection (1) are to notify the competent foreigners authority immediately if, in discharging their duties, they become aware of

1.  the whereabouts of a foreigner who does not possess a required residence title and whose deportation has not been suspended,

2.  a breach of a geographic restriction,

2a.  foreigners drawing or applying for social benefits for themselves, their family members or other household members in the cases covered by section 7 (1) sentence 2 no. 2 or sentence 4 of Book Two of the Social Code or in the cases covered by section 23 (3) sentence 1 nos. 2 or 3, sentences 3, 6 or 7 of Book Twelve of the Social Code, unless the information on the drawing of social benefits has already been entered in the Central Register of Foreigners, or

3.  any other grounds for expulsion or

4.  a departure of the foreigner which is not of a temporary nature, unless this information has already been entered in the Central Register of Foreigners;

in the cases covered by nos. 1 and 2 and in case of any other actions punishable under this Act, the competent police authority may be notified instead of the foreigners authority, if one of the measures specified in section 71 (5) is possible; the police authority immediately notifies the foreigners authority. As a rule, public bodies are to notify the competent foreigners authority immediately if, in discharging their duties, they become aware of special integration needs within the meaning of a statutory instrument enacted under section 43 (4). In addition to the cases regulated in sentence 1, the bodies responsible for benefits under Book Two or Book Twelve of the Social Code are required to notify the foreigners authority if a foreigner holding a temporary residence permit under Chapter 2 Divisions 3 or 4 applies for such benefits for him- or herself or for family members. The diplomatic missions abroad transmit to the competent foreigners authority personal data on a foreigner which is suitable for establishing the latter’s identity or nationality, should they become aware that such data may be of current significance in enforcing the foreigner’s enforceable obligation to leave the federal territory.

(3) The Federal Government Commissioner for Migration, Refugees and Integration is required to provide notifications under subsections (1) and (2) regarding a foreigner belonging to this category of persons only if such notification does not threaten the Commissioner's ability to discharge his or her own duties. The _Land_ governments may determine by statutory instrument that foreigners commissioners of the _Land_ and of local government authorities are required to provide notifications pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) relating to a foreigner who is lawfully resident in the _Land_ or local government district concerned or who resided lawfully in the _Land_ or local government district up to the time an administrative act was issued terminating the lawfulness of the residence subject to sentence 1 only.

(4) The bodies responsible for initiating and implementing criminal or administrative fine proceedings are to notify the competent foreigners authority immediately that such criminal proceedings have been initiated and that the criminal or fine proceedings have been settled at the public prosecutor’s office, in court or at the administrative authority competent for prosecuting the administrative offence and imposing due punishment, stating the relevant statutory provisions. Sentence 1 applies accordingly to criminal proceedings to bring public charges as well as to issue and cancel an arrest warrant and to enforce the arrest warrant or suspend its enforcement, as long as this does not jeopardise the purpose of the investigation. Sentence 1 applies accordingly to initiating extradition proceedings against a foreigner. Sentence 1 does not apply to proceedings for an administrative offence which is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 euros, nor to proceedings for an offence within the meaning of section 24 of the Road Traffic Act or for an offence committed negligently within the meaning of section 24a of the Road Traffic Act. The Office for the Protection of Witnesses notifies the competent foreigners authority immediately of the beginning and end of witness protection for a foreigner.

(5) The bodies to be consulted in accordance with section 72 (6) are to notify the foreigners authorities

1.  ex officio of any circumstances justifying the revocation of a residence title issued pursuant to section 25 (4a) or (4b) or the shortening or annulment of a deadline for leaving the country granted pursuant to section 59 (7) and

2.  ex officio of the competent body or of any transfer of competence, where involvement in criminal proceedings pursuant to section 72 (6) has taken place or notification has been effected pursuant to no. 1.

(6) Public or private bodies which decide on publicly funded measures to promote return and reintegration must transmit data collected under section 86a (1) to the competent foreigners authority to the extent necessary for the purposes listed in section 86a.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p1968)

Section 88  
Transfer of data and information in the case of special statutory regulations on the processing of data

(1) Personal data and other information are not transmitted under section 87, if such transmission conflicts with special statutory regulations on the processing of data.

(2) Personal data made accessible to a public body by a doctor or by other persons referred to in section 203 (1) nos. 1, 2, 4 to 7 and subsection (4) of the Criminal Code may be transmitted by said public body

1.  if necessary to avert serious threats to the life and limb of the foreigner or of others, or if the foreigner constitutes a risk to public health, and special protective measures to eliminate the risk are not possible or fail to be observed by the foreigner, or

2.  if the data are required in order to ascertain whether the conditions specified in section 54 (2) no. 4 apply.

(3) Personal data subject to tax secrecy under section 30 of the German Fiscal Code (_Abgabenordnung_) may be transmitted if the foreigner has violated a provision of tax law, including customs law and monopolies law or a provision of foreign trade and payments law, or has violated import, export or transit bans or bans on the introduction of goods into customs territory, and criminal investigations have been initiated or a fine of at least 500 euros has been imposed for such violation. In cases covered by sentence 1, the authorities charged with policing cross-border traffic may also be notified if a departure ban is to be issued under section 46 (2).

(4) Subsections (1) to (3) apply accordingly to transmission by the authorities charged with implementing this Act and by private bodies.

[table of contents](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/index.html#gl_p1975)

Section 88a  
Processing data in connection with integration measures

(1) In conducting integration courses, the foreigners authority, the Federal Employment Agency, the institution providing basic income support for jobseekers, institutions providing services under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act, the Federal Office of Administration and private and public institutions authorised to conduct integration courses are permitted to transmit data relating to participants to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, in particular data confirming entitlement to attend, permission to attend pursuant to section 44 (4) and registration for and attendance of an integration course as far as necessary to grant permission or entitlement to attend the integration course, to verify proper participation, to verify the fulfilment of the obligation to attend in accordance with section 44a (1) sentence 1, to certify successful participation or to invoice and conduct integration courses. The private and public institutions authorised to conduct integration courses may inform the competent foreigners authority, the Federal Employment Agency, the competent institution providing basic income support for jobseekers or the competent institution providing services under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act of the failure by a foreigner obliged to participate in an integration course under section 44a (1) sentence 1 to duly attend an integration course or a foreigner whose participation in an integration course is provided for by a cooperation plan pursuant to section 15 (2) of Book Two of the Social Code. On request, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees may transmit the data transmitted pursuant to sentence 1 to foreigners authorities, the Federal Employment Agency, institutions providing basic income support for jobseekers or institutions providing services under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act and nationality authorities as far as necessary to grant permission or entitlement to attend an integration course, to verify the fulfilment of the obligation to attend, to extend a temporary residence permit, to grant a permanent settlement permit or an EU long-term residence permit, to supervise the integration agreement in accordance with Book Two of the Social Code in the version valid until 30 June 2023 or the cooperation plan in accordance with Book Two of the Social Code in the version valid from 1 July 2023, to integrate the foreigner in the labour market, or to conduct the naturalisation procedure. Furthermore, the processing of these data by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees is permissible only to conduct and invoice integration courses and to conduct a scientific research project in accordance with section 75 no. 4a under the conditions set out in section 8 (7) and (8) of the Ordinance on Integration Courses (_Integrationskursverordnung_).

(1a) Subsection (1) applies accordingly to the processing of data resulting from the asylum procedure conducted at the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees as far as necessary to take a decision on whether to admit a foreigner to an integration course. This also applies accordingly to the processing of data taken from the Central Register of Foreigners in order to ascertain the conditions under section 44 (4) sentence 2 in the context of deciding whether to admit a foreigner to an integration course.

(2) If the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees enlists the services of private or public institutions to provide migration advisory services pursuant to section 75 no. 9, these institutions are permitted to transmit to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees aggregated data on the advisory services provided.

(3) When conducting job-related language training courses in accordance with section 45a, the foreigners authority, the Federal Employment Agency, the institution providing basic income support for jobseekers, the Federal Office of Administration and the private and public institutions conducting the courses are permitted to transmit to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees data relating to course participants concerning registration, length of attendance and the manner in which the course was concluded as far as necessary to grant admission to the course, ascertain and verify fulfilment of the obligation to duly attend, and to conduct and invoice the course. On request, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees may transmit the data transmitted in accordance with sentence 1 to foreigners authorities, the Federal Employment Agency, institutions providing basic income support for jobseekers and nationality authorities as far as necessary to grant permission or entitlement to attend an integration course, verify fulfilment of the obligation to duly attend, grant a permanent settlement permit or an EU long-term residence permit, supervise the integration agreement in accordance with Book Two of the Social Code in the version valid until 30 June 2023 or the cooperation plan in accordance with Book Two of the Social Code in the version valid from 1 July 2023, to integrate the foreigner in the labour market, or to conduct the naturalisation procedure. The private and public institutions authorised to conduct the job-related language training may inform the competent foreigners authority, the Federal Employment Agency or the competent institution providing basic income support for jobseekers of a foreigner’s failure to duly attend.

(4) The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees may transmit to state or state-recognised higher education institutions or to other research organisations financed primarily from public funds data relating to course participants concerning registration, length of attendance and the manner in which the measure referred to in subsection (3) sentence 1 was concluded, the type of course as referred to in section 12 (1) or section 13 (1) as well as the data transmitted in accordance with section 26 (1) nos. 1 to 5, 7, 9 and 10 of the Ordinance on German Language Training (_Deutschsprachförderverordnung_) as far as

1.  necessary for carrying out a scientific research project on integration issues,

2.  it is not possible to use anonymised data for this purpose, or anonymisation would require unreasonable effort,

3.  the legitimate interests of the persons concerned are not harmed, or the public interest in carrying out the research project significantly outweighs the legitimate interests of the persons concerned and the research purpose cannot be achieved in any other way, and

4.  the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs approves the transmission.

The weighing-up of interests in accordance with sentence 1 no. 3 is to give special attention to the scientific interest in the research project as part of the public interest. No transmission is permitted without the consent of the person concerned. Information about the surname and given names, address, telephone number, email address and structural features of the person concerned which are urgently needed to initiate a project as referred to in sentence 1 may be transmitted without consent if necessary to obtain consent; the reasons for this need are to be provided in writing to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. Personal data as referred to in sentence 1 are to be pseudonymised if possible given the research purpose and if it does not require unreasonable effort in proportion to the intended purpose of protection. Features which enable specific persons to be identified are to be stored separately. They may be combined with the individual details only if this is necessary for the research purpose. Features which enable specific persons to be identified are to be deleted as soon as the research purpose allows and no later than the end of the research project unless it is possible by way of exception to delete the data earlier. The data are to be anonymised as soon as the research purpose allows. The research organisation to which the data were transmitted may only process the data to carry out the research project.

Section 89  
Procedures to verify, establish and document a foreigner’s identity

(1) The Federal Criminal Police Office provides official assistance in assessing the data which are collected under section 49 by the authorities entrusted with implementing this Act and which are transferred under section 73. It may also use the identification data it has stored in the discharge of its duties. The data collected under section 49 (3) to (5) and (8) and (9) are stored separately from other identification data. The data referred to in section 49 (7) are kept by the authority creating the records.

(1a) When providing official assistance under subsection (1) sentence 1, the Federal Criminal Police Office may, in order to establish the identity of the person concerned, also transmit the identification data referred to in subsection (1) sentence 1 to the public bodies of third countries which are responsible for examining the identity of persons, excepting the public bodies of the person’s country of origin and those of third states where he or she has reason to fear persecution or serious harm. The Federal Criminal Police Office is responsible for the lawfulness of the transmission. The Federal Criminal Police Office is to record the transmission and the reason for it. The body receiving personal data is to be notified that the data may be processed only for the purpose for which they were transmitted. Furthermore, the receiving body is to be informed of the date on which the data are to be deleted at the Federal Criminal Police Office.

Personal data are not transmitted if there is factual evidence that,

1.  taking into account the type of data and the way they were collected, the legitimate interests of the person concerned, above all his or her interest in receiving protection from persecution, override the general interest in the transmission, or

2.  the transmission of the data would conflict with the person’s basic rights, the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951 or the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, particularly because processing the transmitted data in the receiving state threatens to violate fundamental principles of the rule of law or human rights.

(2) Processing the data obtained under section 49 (3) to (5) or (7) to (9) is also permitted to establish the foreigner’s identity or attribute evidence in the course of criminal prosecution or measures taken by the police to avert threats. These data may be transmitted or made available to the authorities responsible for these measures, to the extent and for the duration necessary.

(3) The data collected under section 49 (1) are to be deleted by all authorities immediately after completing the authenticity of the document or the identity of the holder has been checked. The data collected under section 49 (3) to (5), (7), (8) or (9) are deleted by all authorities storing such data if

1.  the foreigner has been issued with a valid passport or passport substitute and granted a residence title by the foreigners authority,

2.  10 years have elapsed since the foreigner’s last departure from the federal territory, the attempted unlawful entry or the termination of an unlawful stay,

3.  three years have elapsed since refusal of entry or removal in cases covered by section 49 (5) nos. 3 and 4 or

4.  10 years have elapsed since application for the visa in cases covered by section 49 (5) no. 5 and since the voice recording in the case of section 49 (7).

Deletion of the data is to be documented.

(4) Subsection (3) does not apply if and for as long as the data are required in connection with criminal proceedings or to avert a threat to public safety or law and order.

(1) The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees receives applications pursuant to section 19b and forwards them to the competent foreigners authority. It informs the applicant of the competent foreigners authority.

(2) On request, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees furnishes the competent authority of another member state of the European Union with the necessary information in order to enable the competent authorities of the other member state of the European Union to verify whether the requirements for the foreigner’s mobility under Directive 2014/66/EU are met. This information comprises

1.  the foreigner’s personal details and information on his or her identity and travel documents,

2.  information on the foreigner’s present and former residence status in Germany,

3.  information on completed criminal investigations or such investigations which are known to the foreigners authority,

4.  other data concerning the foreigner which are stored in the Central Register of Foreigners or which originate from the foreigner’s file or the visa file and which have been requested by the other member state of the European Union.

To this end, at the request of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, the foreigners authorities and the diplomatic missions abroad transmit to the Federal Office the data required to provide the information.

(3) The diplomatic missions abroad and the foreigners authorities may address requests for information to competent bodies of other member states of the European Union through the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, where this is necessary in order to check whether the mobility requirements under section 19a are met or to issue a Mobile ICT Card. To this end, they may transmit

1.  the foreigner’s personal details,

2.  information on the foreigner’s identity and travel documents and on his or her residence title issued in another member state of the European Union, and

3.  information on the subject of the application for the residence title and on where such application was filed

and, where pertinent, specify the desired information in precise terms. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees forwards information which it receives to the competent foreigners authorities and diplomatic missions abroad. The foreigners authorities and diplomatic missions abroad may process the data transmitted in the information furnished by the competent bodies of other member states of the European Union for this purpose.

(4) The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees notifies the competent authority of another member state of the European Union in which the foreigner concerned possesses an ICT Card as to the content and date of a decision on

1.  denying, under section 19a (1), mobility notified under section 19a (4), and

2.  issuing a Mobile ICT Card under section 19b.

(5) Where an ICT Card under section 19 is revoked or withdrawn or not extended or if it expires after the period is reduced in accordance with section 7 (2) sentence 2 is reduced, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees immediately informs the competent authority of the other member state where the foreigner has made use of the possibility envisaged in Directive 2014/66/EU to carry out part of the intra-corporate transfer in another member state of the European Union, provided the foreigners authority is aware of this. The authority which has reached the decision transmits the necessary data to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees without delay. The foreigners authorities may transfer the data from the Central Register of Foreigners required for notifications under sentence 1 to the National Contact Point by means of an automated process, using the Central Foreigners Register number. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees notifies the competent foreigners authority without delay of any case where it has been informed by the competent authority of another member state that a residence title held by a foreigner who is residing in the federal territory under sections 19a or 19b and which comes under the scope of Directive 2014/66 (EU) has expired or been revoked, withdrawn, or not extended.

(6) The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees annually transmits to the competent bodies of the European Union

a)  of ICT Cards issued for the first time,

b)  of Mobile ICT Cards issued for the first time, and

c)  of notifications under section 19a (1),

2.  the nationality of the foreigner in every individual case, and

Section 104  
Transitional provisions

(1) Decisions on applications filed prior to 1 January 2005 for an unlimited residence permit or a right of unlimited residence are to be taken in accordance with the law applicable until that time. Section 101 (1) applies accordingly.

(2) In the case of foreigners in possession of a temporary residence permit or a residence title for exceptional circumstances prior to 1 January 2005, for the purposes of the decision on granting a permanent settlement permit or an EU long-term residence permit it is sufficient with regard to their knowledge of the language if they are able to communicate verbally in the German language at a basic level. Section 9 (2) sentence 1 nos. 3 and 8 do not apply.

(3) In the case of foreigners lawfully resident in Germany before 1 January 2005, section 20 of the Foreigners Act applies in its most recently amended version with regard to the subsequent immigration of children born before this date, unless this Residence Act grants a more favourable legal status.

(6) Section 23 (2) in the version valid until 24 May 2007 continues to apply in such cases in which the order issued by the supreme _Land_ authority on the basis of the version applicable until 24 May 2007 provides for issuing a permanent settlement permit where special political interests of the Federal Republic of Germany prevail. Section 23 (2) sentence 5 and section 44 (1) no. 2 apply accordingly to the affected foreigners and the dependants relocating their residence to the federal territory with the former.

(7) A permanent settlement permit may also be issued to spouses, civil partners and minor, unmarried children of a foreigner who were in possession of a residence title for exceptional circumstances pursuant to section 31 (1) of the Foreigners Act or a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 35 (2) of the Foreigners Act prior to 1 January 2005, if the conditions of section 26 (4) are met and they continue to meet the conditions according to which issuance of a residence title for exceptional circumstances pursuant to section 31 of the Foreigners Act or of a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 35 (2) of the Foreigners Act was permissible.

(8) Section 28 (2) in the version applicable until 5 September 2013 continues to apply to such dependants of German nationals who already held a residence title under section 28 (1) on 5 September 2013.

(9) Foreigners who possess a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 25 (3), because the Federal Office or the foreigners authority has established that deportation bans exist in line with section 60 (2), (3) or (7) sentence 2, in the version valid before 1 December 2013, are deemed to be entitled to subsidiary protection as referred to in section 4 (1) of the Asylum Act, and are ex officio issued with a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 25 (2) sentence 1 second alternative, unless the Federal Office has informed the foreigners authority that grounds exist for refusing the person concerned such status in line with section 25 (3) sentence 2 (a) to (d) in the version valid before 1 December 2013. The periods of possession of a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 25 (3) sentence 1 in the version valid before 1 December 2013 are equal to the periods of possession of a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 25 (2) sentence 1 second alternative. Section 73b of the Asylum Act applies accordingly.

(10) As from 1 February 2016, section 73b (4) applies to persons concerned in accordance with section 73b (1) who pursue their activities as non-seconded employees of the Federal Foreign Office in a diplomatic mission abroad.

(11) The period referred to in section 29 (2) sentence 2 no. 1 begins to run upon the entry into force of this Act for foreigners who were incontestably granted subsidiary protection pursuant to Directive 2011/95/EU or Directive 2004/38/EC between 1 January 2011 and 31 July 2015.

(12) In the case of a deportation warning under sections 34 and 35 of the Asylum Act or a deportation order pursuant to section 34a of the Asylum Act issued prior to 1 August 2015, responsibility for ordering a ban on entry and residence under section 11 lies with the foreigners authorities.

Section 27 (3a) applies accordingly.

(14) (repealed)

(15) If temporary suspension of deportation was granted under section 60a (2) sentence 4 in the version valid until 31 December 2019, section 19d (1) nos. 4 and 5 does not apply if the foreigner has taken the necessary and reasonable measures to verify his or her identity when the application for a temporary residence permit was filed under section 19d.

(16) Section 60a (6) in the version valid until 31 December 2019 continues to apply to the jobs which foreigners possessing a temporary suspension of deportation were allowed to perform until that date.

Section 104a  
Regulations governing old cases

(1) In derogation from section 5 (1) no. 1 and subsection (2), a foreigner whose deportation has been suspended is to be granted a temporary residence permit as a general rule where the foreigner has continuously resided in the federal territory for at least eight years on 1 July 2007, or, if the foreigner lives together with one or more minor, unmarried children as a family unit, where he or she has continuously resided in the federal territory for at least six years on the said date, by virtue of his or her deportation having been suspended, being permitted to remain pending the asylum decision or on account of a temporary residence or permanent settlement permit having been issued on humanitarian grounds and he or she

1.  has sufficient living space at his or her disposal,

2.  has an elementary oral command of the German language corresponding to level A2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages,

3.  furnishes proof that any children of school age actually attend school,

4.  has not intentionally deceived the foreigners authority as to circumstances relevant to his or her situation under residence law and has not intentionally delayed or obstructed official measures to end his or her residence,

5.  does not have any links to extremist or terrorist organisations and does not support such organisations and

6.  has not been convicted of an offence intentionally committed in the federal territory; fines totalling up to 50 daily rates or up to 90 daily rates in the case of offences which, in accordance with the Residence Act or the Asylum Act, can only be committed by foreigners are to be ignored as a general principle.

Where foreigners ensure their subsistence independently by means of an economic activity, the temporary residence permit is granted pursuant to section 23 (1) sentence 1. In all other cases, it is issued in accordance with sentence 1; it applies as a residence title under Chapter 2 Division 5; sections 9 and 26 (4) do not apply. The requirement stated in sentence 1 no. 2 may be waived until 1 July 2008. The requirement stated in sentence 1 no. 2 is waived if the foreigner is unable to meet it on account of a physical or mental illness or disability or on grounds of old age.

(2) An adult unmarried child whose deportation has been suspended, who is the child of a foreigner whose deportation has been suspended and who has been continuously resident in the federal territory for at least eight years on 1 July 2007, or, if the foreigner lives together with one or more minor, unmarried children as a family unit, where the child has been continuously resident in the federal territory for at least six years on the said date, by virtue of his or her deportation having been suspended, being permitted to remain pending the asylum decision or on account of a temporary residence or permanent settlement permit having been issued on humanitarian grounds, may be granted a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 23 (1) sentence 1 where said child was a minor at the time of entering the federal territory and where it appears, on the basis of the child’s education and way of life to date, that he or she is capable of integrating into the way of life in the Federal Republic of Germany. The same applies to a foreigner who has been continuously resident in the federal territory for at least six years as an unaccompanied minor by virtue of his or her deportation having been suspended, being permitted to remain pending the asylum decision or on account of a temporary residence or permanent settlement permit having been issued on humanitarian grounds, where it appears, on the basis of the child’s education and way of life to date, that he or she is capable of integrating into the way of life in the Federal Republic of Germany.

(3) If a family member living as part of a family household has committed offences pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 6, this leads to denial of the temporary residence permit for other family members according to this provision. Sentence 1 does not apply to the spouse of a foreigner who has committed offences within the meaning of subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 6 where the spouse otherwise meets the requirements of subsection (1) and it is necessary to enable the continued stay of the spouse in order to avoid special hardship. Where, in exceptional cases, children are separated from their parents, their care and welfare in Germany must be ensured.

(4) The temporary residence permit may be issued subject to the condition that the foreigner attend an integration interview or that an integration agreement be concluded.

(5) The temporary residence permit is issued with a period of validity until 31 December 2009. As a general rule, it is to be extended by two further years as a temporary residence permit under section 23 (1) sentence 1 if the foreigner’s subsistence was ensured up to 31 December 2009 primarily because the foreigner pursued an economic activity or if the foreigner has permanently ensured his or her subsistence at least since 1 April 2009. In both cases, there must be reason to believe that the foreigner’s subsistence will be for the most part ensured in the future. In the case of subsection (1) sentence 4 the temporary residence permit is issued with an initial period of validity until 1 July 2008 and is extended only if the foreigner furnishes proof that he or she meets the conditions of subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 2 by the aforesaid date at the latest. Section 81 (4) does not apply.

(6) With regard to extension of the temporary residence permit, derogation from subsection (5) is possible in order to avoid cases of hardship. This provision applies in the case of

1.  apprentices undergoing training in a recognised trade or in government-sponsored pre-vocational training measures,

2.  families with children who are only temporarily reliant on supplementary social benefits,

3.  single parents who are temporarily reliant on social benefits and who cannot reasonably be expected to take up employment pursuant to section 10 (1) no. 3 of Book Two of the Social Code,

4.  persons who are unable to work but whose subsistence and any necessary care is secured on a long-term basis by any other means without recourse to any public benefits, except where the benefits are based on paid contributions,

5.  persons who are 65 years of age or older on 31 December 2009, if they have no family in their country of origin but do have dependants (children or grandchildren) who are permanently resident in the federal territory or German nationals and if it is thus ensured that no social benefits will be claimed for such persons.

(7) The _Länder_ may order a temporary residence permit in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) to be denied to nationals of certain states on grounds of national security for the Federal Republic of Germany. In order to ensure a nationwide uniform approach, the order requires the approval of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community.

Section 104b  
Right of residence for integrated children of foreigners whose deportation has been suspended

In derogation from section 5 (1) no. 1, subsection (2) and section 10 (3) sentence 1, a minor, unmarried child may be granted a temporary residence permit in his or her own right pursuant to section 23 (1) sentence 1 if the child’s parents or the parent possessing the sole right of care and custody are not granted a temporary residence permit or an extension of the same pursuant to section 104a and are leaving the federal territory, provided

1.  the child has reached the age of 14 by 1 July 2007,

2.  the child has been lawfully resident in Germany or resident in Germany by virtue of suspended deportation for at least six years,

3.  the child has an advanced command of the German language,

4.  on the basis of the child’s education and way of life to date, he or she has integrated into the way of life in the Federal Republic of Germany and it is ensured that the child will remain integrated in this way of life in the future and

5.  care and custody of the child are ensured.

Section 104c  
Residence opportunities for well-integrated foreigners whose deportation has been suspended

(1) In derogation from section 5 (1) nos. 1, 1a and 4 as well as section 5 (2), foreigners whose deportation has been suspended are, as a general rule, to be granted a temporary residence permit if, by 31 October 2022, they had resided in the federal territory on the basis of a temporary residence permit, suspended deportation or permission to remain pending the asylum decision for five years without interruption and

1.  they declare their commitment to the free democratic basic order of the Federal Republic of Germany and

2.  they have not been convicted of an offence intentionally committed in the federal territory; fines totalling up to 50 daily rates or up to 90 daily rates in the case of offences which, in accordance with the Residence Act or the Asylum Act, can only be committed by foreigners are to be ignored as a general principle, as are convictions under juvenile criminal law that do not order juvenile detention.

As a general rule, a temporary residence permit as referred to in sentence 1 is to be denied to foreigners who have repeatedly and intentionally furnished false information or have deceived the authorities as to their identity or nationality, thereby hindering their deportation. The time periods referred to in section 60b (5) sentence 1 are to be counted in applying sentence 1.

(2) The spouse, civil partner and any minor unmarried children living as a family unit with a foreigner granted a temporary residence permit under subsection (1) are, as a general rule, to be granted a temporary residence permit if they meet the requirements of subsection (1) nos. 1 and 2 even if, by 31 October 2022, they had not yet resided in the federal territory on the basis of a temporary residence permit, suspended deportation or permission to remain pending the asylum decision for five years without interruption. The same applies to adult unmarried children who were minors at the time they entered the federal territory. Subsection (1) sentence 2 applies accordingly.

(3) The temporary residence permit may be granted in derogation from section 10 (3) sentence 2. The temporary residence permit is deemed a residence title in accordance with Chapter 2 Division 5. It is granted with a validity of 18 months and cannot be renewed. During residence as referred to in sentence 3, only a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 25a or 25b may be granted. An application for a residence title other than one pursuant to section 25a or 25b does not have the effect referred to in section 81 (4).

(4) At least by the time they are granted the temporary residence permit, foreigners are to be informed of the requirements for granting a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 25b and, if the foreigner is not yet 27 years old, pursuant to section 25a. When providing this information, the foreigners authorities are, as a general rule, to describe specific obligations which the foreigners can reasonably be expected to fulfil.

Section 105  
Transitional arrangements for the temporary suspension of deportation for persons whose identity is not verified

(1) As regards foreigners whose deportation has been suspended, the foreigners authority does not decide on issuing a certificate confirming the suspension of deportation under section 60a (4) with the additional wording “_for persons whose identity is not verified_” until it examines whether to extend the suspension of deportation or grant the suspension of deportation for another reason.

(2) Until 1 July 2020, section 60b does not apply to foreigners whose deportation has been suspended and who are in a training or employment relationship.

(3) Section 60b does not apply to foreigners who hold a temporary suspension of deportation for the purpose of training or employment or who have applied for it and meet the necessary requirements.

Authorisation to provide health care temporarily

(1) If there are not enough doctors licensed in accordance with the Federal Medical Code (_Bundesärzteordnung_) to provide health care for foreigners who already have or have applied for a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 24 (1) and who have been issued a provisional residence document pursuant to section 81 (5) in conjunction with subsection (3) in a reception centre or another facility designated by the _Land_ for accommodating these persons, and if this endangers the provision of health care for these foreigners in these facilities, foreigners who already have or have applied for a temporary residence permit pursuant to section 24 (1) and who have been issued a provisional residence document pursuant to section 81 (5) in conjunction with subsection (3) who live in these facilities and have completed their medical training may temporarily, upon application, be authorised to practise general medicine in these facilities in order to help doctors in providing health care for these persons.

1.  the activity is carried out under the responsibility of a medical doctor;

2.  the professional title “doctor” may not be used;

3.  the authorisation to provide care only covers persons in a reception centre or another facility designated by the _Land_ for accommodating these persons;

(4) Granting authorisation pursuant to subsection (1) requires that

1.  the applicant furnishes prima facie evidence of his qualification as a doctor, and

2.  the applicant cannot be licensed or permitted to practise medicine temporarily pursuant to sections 3 or 10 of the Federal Medical Code because the necessary certificates or documentation cannot be presented for reasons beyond the applicant’s control.

In order to furnish prima facie evidence of qualification as referred to in sentence 1 no. 1, the applicant must declare in lieu of an oath that he or she has completed training as a doctor and provide evidence of his or her training and competence as a doctor in an interview conducted by a doctor appointed by the responsible authority.

(6) The procedure for granting the authorisation referred to in subsections (1) to (5) is conducted by the responsible authority of the _Land_ where medicine is to be practised, or by the _Land_ or joint entity agreed on in accordance with section 12 (3) sentence 3 of the Federal Medical Code.
